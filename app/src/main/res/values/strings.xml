    <string name="hadean_description">Hadean Eon – the earliest part of the Earth history, which covers times from the beginning of the formation of the Earth until the formation of the tectonic plates 4.0 billion years ago.\nThe landscape of the Early Hadean looked like hell. The surface was covered by volcanoes and molten rock, and the planet was constantly attacked by meteorites and comets.\nThe first 100 million years were too inhospitable for any kind of life, with surface temperatures of 230 degrees celsius (at the beginning even 2000 degrees), and atmospheric pressure 27 times higher than now. Earth possessed an atmosphere, but it was repeatedly lost because of frequent collisions with other space objects.\n4.4 billion years ago planet began to cool; zircon discoveries provide evidences of liquid water during that time. The end of this eon is marked by the formation of the oceans and continental crust.</string>
    <string name="hadean_additional_title"></string>
    <string name="hadean_additional"></string>
    <string name="hadean_life_forms">There is no hard proof that any life form could exist in such a harsh environment; however there are 4.1-billion-year-old findings of carbon minerals in Western Australia, which provide evidence that there could have been sustainable conditions for life. Some scientists think that life may have arisen multiple times, but was repeatedly wiped out in frequent cataclysms. The main source of organic particles – carbon meteorites – may provide evidence that life exists outside of Earth.</string>

    <string name="archean_physics">Mean temperature: 45&#8211;70 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 0%</string>
    <string name="archean_description">Archean Eon – the second huge eon in the Earth history, which covers times from the formation of the first tectonic plates 4.0 billion years ago until the Great Oxidation Event 2.5 billion years ago.\nAt the beginning of this eon, Earth’s temperature was 2-3 times higher than the today. The causes of this phenomenon were: high concentration of greenhouse gases (tens of times higher than today) and heat from the formation and growth of the planet core.\nAt that time Sun had about 70&#8211;75% of the present luminosity. By the end of this eon, Earth’s tectonics were similar to the present, and there were vast oceans of liquid water.</string>
    <string name="archean_additional_title">Late heavy bombardment</string>
    <string name="archean_additional">4.0 billion years ago, the planets of our solar system (including Earth) were heavily bombarded by large cosmic bodies for approximately 200 million years. Evidence of this event was returned to earth by the Apollo astronauts in form of lunar samples.\nExtrapolating lunar cratering rates to the Earth at this time suggests the following number of craters would have formed:\n1. 22,000 craters with diameters bigger than 20 km.\n2. 40 craters with diameters bigger than 1000 km.\n3. Several craters with diameter around 5000 km.\nThe main hypothesis for this cause is that the giant planets (like Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune) underwent orbital migration, and in doing so, scattered objects in the asteroid and/or Kuiper belts into eccentric orbits, and into the path of the terrestrial planets. This event might have postponed the creation of life at the Early Archean.</string>
    <string name="archean_life_forms">Unlike in the Hadean, the existence of life during the Archean is not in doubt, although there are disputes about the time life first appeared.\nThe first solid evidence of life comes from the 3.85-billion-year-old banded iron formations found in Greenland. These formations require oxygen for their formation, and the only source of oxygen during that time was photosynthesis, so the existence of these formations is direct evidence of life.\nPossible first prokaryotes have been found in Canadian rocks that are at least 3.77 billion years old, and by judging lipid biomarkers, the first eukaryotes might have appeared by the end of the period, about 2.7 billion years ago.</string>

    <string name="proterozoic_physics">Mean temperature: 5&#8211;45 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 0&#8211;12%</string>
    <string name="proterozoic_description">Proterozoic Eon – the third large eon, which covers times just before the proliferation of complex life on Earth. The most important events of this time were the transition to an oxygenated atmosphere, several global glaciations (the Snowball Earth hypothesis), and the evolution of soft-bodied, multicellular organisms.\nThis is a hypothetical reconstruction of a Snowball Earth during the Huronian and Cryogenian glaciations.</string>
    <string name="proterozoic_additional_title">Great Oxidation Event</string>
    <string name="proterozoic_additional">The Great Oxidation Event was the biologically induced appearance of oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere which happened around 2.5 billion years ago. The general hypothesis states that the main cause of this event was the development of oxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria.\nBefore this event, any free oxygen was chemically captured by dissolved iron or organic matter, but once these oxygen sinks became saturated, oxygen was free to escape into atmosphere.\nFree oxygen is toxic to obligate anaerobic organisms, so this event caused their mass extinction. Additionally, oxygen reacted with atmospheric methane, greatly reducing its concentration and triggering Huronian glaciation, which lasted about 300 million years (2400&#8211;2100 mya).\nThese tremendous changes in Earth’s chemical interactions provided a new opportunity for biological diversification, as life adapted to tolerate and then take advantage of atmospheric oxygen. This breakthrough in metabolic evolution greatly increased the free energy supply to living organisms, allowing the creation of new, more complex morphologies.</string>
    <string name="proterozoic_life_forms">This eon represents the evolution of life from simple to more complex forms. During the Great Oxidation Event most of the anaerobic organisms were replaced by more advanced protista and bacteria. By halfway through the eon, stromatolites saw their greatest diversity, and the ancestors of fungi diverged from the ancestors of animals. By the Ediacaran (635 mya), the first advanced, soft bodied multicellular organisms had appeared.</string>

    <string name="cambrian_physics">Mean temperature: 21 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 12.5%</string>
    <string name="cambrian_description">The Cambrian period was the first geological period of the Paleozoic era, it marked a profound change in life on Earth. Prior to the Cambrian, the majority of living organisms were small and simple. However, in the Cambrian rapid diversification occurred, in an event is known as the Cambrian Explosion. The great glaciers of the Proterozoic eon were long melted – the sea level was high, which led to large areas of the continents being flooded by warm, shallow seas ideal for sea life.\nThe Earth was generally cool during the Early Cambrian, probably due to the ancient continent of Gondwana covering the South Pole and cutting off polar ocean currents. However, average temperatures were still 7 degrees higher than today. There were likely polar ice caps and a series of glaciations, but it became warmer towards the end of the period; the glaciers retreated and eventually disappeared, and sea levels rose dramatically. This trend would continue into the Ordovician period.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_additional_title">The Cambrian Explosion</string>
    <string name="cambrian_additional">The Cambrian explosion was a relatively short evolutionary event, during which 63% of all biological classes, and most of the major modern animal phyla, appeared. The most notable events were the appearance of burrowing and the diversification of skeletonized animals, which were absent or rare before the Cambrian.\nPossible causes of this event:\n1. Increased available oxygen.\n2. Ozone formation, which decreased the deadly effects of UV rays.\n3. The Snowball Earth event during the Proterozoic, which caused a mass extinction of the previous life forms, freeing up many ecological niches.\n4. Increased calcium concentration in Cambrian seawater, which made it possible for marine organisms to build skeletons and hard body parts.\n5. Developmental changes – appearance of self-organization and body plans triggered by the new Hox genes.\n6. Changes in the food chain – appearance of coevolution, when predators and prey started “arms races”.\nThe Cambrian was also a period of nature experimenting with body forms, and many strange animal phenotypes appeared.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_life_forms">Most animal life during the Cambrian was aquatic. Arthropods were by far the most dominant animals in the ocean, and many new mineralized and burrowing animals appeared. However, unlike in modern times, most animals were still living on or near the sea floor.</string>

    <string name="ordovician_physics">Mean temperature: 16 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 13.5%</string>
    <string name="ordovician_description">The Ordovician is the second of six periods of the Paleozoic era. During this period ancient oceans separated the barren continents of Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia and Gondwana. The end of the Ordovician was one of the coldest times in Earth history. Ice covered much of the southern region of Gondwana.</string>
    <string name="ordovician_additional_title">Ordovician Radiation</string>
    <string name="ordovician_additional">Also called the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE), which replaced the distinctive Cambrian fauna with a Paleozoic fauna, rich in suspension feeders and pelagic animals. It happened just after the Cambrian-Ordovician extinction, which was probably caused by a sudden glaciation and the depletion of the available oxygen in the sea.\nThe main cause of the Ordovician radiation was a major change in paleogeography. Because of the high sea levels, continents became very provincial. Orogeny (together with erosion) became very intense and caused high productivity of the ecosystems during that time, because of the increase in available nutrients.\nThe Cambrian Explosion was important, because it created most of the modern phyla, but the GOBE can be considered as the filling out of the phyla with the modern classes and lower-level taxa.</string>
    <string name="ordovician_life_forms">Life during the Ordovician continued to flourish; however, a mass extinction happened at the boundary with Silurian, which wiped out as many as 85% of marine animal species. On the whole, the fauna that emerged in the Ordovician was the template for the remainder of the Palaeozoic.</string>

    <string name="silurian_physics">Mean temperature: 17 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 14%</string>
    <string name="silurian_description">The Silurian is a relatively short geological period, lasting about 25 million years.\nLaurentia collided with Baltica, closing the northern branch of the Iapetus Ocean and forming the \"Old Red Sandstone\" continent. Coral reefs expanded, and land plants began to colonize the barren continents.</string>
    <string name="silurian_additional_title">Terrestrial plant diversification</string>
    <string name="silurian_additional">The evolutionary appearance of vascular plants dramatically altered Earth’s environment, because it paved the way for animal life on land and irrevocably changed Earth’s atmosphere. Puzzlingly, plant evolution was much faster than animal evolution: in the Late Silurian, plants were structurally very simple and small, but by the end of the Devonian (approximately 46 million years later), almost all the present-day plant lineages (except flowering plants) were present.\nThe answer to this may be that conquering the land presented a bigger challenge for plants than for animals. At the level of the individual organism, all plants (except parasitic ones) must perform four very basic functions to grow and survive:\n1. Intercept sunlight.\n2. Exchange atmospheric gases with the environment.\n3. Acquire, transport, and conserve water.\n4. Cope with external mechanical forces.\nEach of these tasks makes the others more difficult. For example: a) when a plant increases its surface area to intercept more sunlight and increase the exchange of gases, its ability to conserve water decreases; b) when a plant positions its leaves horizontally to optimize light interception, it increases mechanical stresses.\nAquatic environments are fairly similar and relatively stable, but terrestrial ones are heavily affected by wind, temperature fluctuations, erratic precipitation, and variations in sunlight. Adapting to life in various land environments therefore requires different answers for each of the tasks mentioned above, which prompted a great diversification in plant body forms.\nGreater exposure to UV light (and resulting mutations) above the surface of the ocean certainly also played a part, but the plant fitness theory best explains the rapid evolution of land plants.</string>
    <string name="silurian_life_forms">Multi-cellular life began to appear on land in the form of small, bryophyte-like and vascular plants that grew beside lakes, streams, and coastlines. Arthropods are also first found on land during the Silurian; however, terrestrial life would not greatly diversify and affect the landscape until the Devonian.\nA significant evolutionary milestone during this period was the diversification of the bony fishes.</string>

    <string name="devonian_physics">Mean temperature: 20 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 15%</string>
    <string name="devonian_description">The Devonian is the fourth of the six periods of the Paleozoic era. It was a relatively warm period, periodically disrupted by glaciations. The weather was very arid, particularly along the equator. By the Devonian, the Early Paleozoic oceans were closing, forming a “pre-Pangea”. Fish were able to migrate from the southern hemisphere continents to North America and Europe. Forests grew for the first time in the equatorial regions of what is now Artic Canada. It ended with a major extinction which wiped out half of all genera.</string>
    <string name="devonian_additional_title">The Late Devonian extinction</string>
    <string name="devonian_additional" formatted="false">The Late Devonian extinction was one of five major extinction events in the history of the Earth. It is not a single event, but sequence of two called Kellwaser and Hangenberg events. It is thought that around 75% of all animal species disappeared. It primarily affected marine life – devastating groups like brachiopods, trilobites and reef-building organisms, which almost completely collapsed. Major fish groups like Placodermi, Heterostraci, and Anaspida were wiped out completely. It destroyed 97% of all vertebrate species, with only smaller forms surviving. After the event, no sharks greater than a meter and almost no fishes and tetrapods greater than 10 centimeters remained, and it would take 10 million years before they started to increase in size again. However, the Late Devonian extinction crucially cleared the way for modern vertebrate fauna, including actinopterygians, chondrichthyans, and tetrapods.\nThe Late Devonian crash in biodiversity was more drastic than the famous extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous.\nThe causes of this extinction are unclear. However, some possibilities are:\n1. Asteroid impact.\n2. Changes in plants (especially of their root system), which caused massive water eutrophication and subsequent anoxia.\n3. Reduction in atmospheric carbon dioxide, which caused global cooling.\n4. Magmatism and increased volcanic activity.</string>
    <string name="devonian_life_forms">Free-sporing vascular plants began to spread across dry land, covering the continents with extensive forests. By the Middle Devonian, several groups of plants had evolved leaves and true roots. Groups like lycophytes, equisetophytes and pteridophytes diversified.\nFish achieved substantial diversity during this time, giving the Devonian the moniker “Age of Fish”. Placodermi were the most dominant. The ancestors of tetrapods began adapting to walk on land, as their strong pectoral and pelvic fins gradually evolved into legs.\nThe first ammonites (a group of molluscs) appeared, and trilobites and the great coral reefs were still common. A now-dry barrier reef, located in what is now the Kimberley Basin of Northwest Australia, once extended a thousand kilometers.</string>

    <string name="carboniferous_physics">Mean temperature: 14 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 32.5%</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_description">The name Carboniferous means “coal-bearing” and it is the period when all the major coal deposits formed. During the Early Carboniferous the Paleozoic oceans between Euramerica and Gondwana began to close, forming the Appalachian and Variscan mountains. An ice cap grew at the South Pole, and four-legged vertebrates evolved in the coal swamps near the Equator.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_additional_title">Carboniferous collapse and coal</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_additional">The Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse was a minor extinction event that occurred around 305 million years ago. It altered the vast coal forests that covered the equatorial region, fragmenting them into isolated islands, which in turn caused dwarfism and, shortly after, extinction of many plant and animal species.\nThis event caused the extinction of the dominant lycopsids and a change to the tree-fern-dominated ecosystems, which were more opportunistic. Before the collapse, the distribution of animal species was very cosmopolitan, but after the collapse each surviving rainforest “island” developed its own unique mix of species; in other words, it caused endemism.\nOxygen levels peaked in the Carboniferous at a record-breaking 32.5%, supporting the enormous arthropods of the time. However, after the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse, oxygen levels declined, and the giant arthropods like Meganeura and Arthropleura were wiped out. Many amphibian species became extinct, as the climate became more arid, creating the opportunity for the diversification of reptiles, which were physiologically better adapted to arid conditions.\nThere are several hypotheses about the nature and cause of this event, but the most widely accepted are the aridification of the climate, and volcanism.\nThis event also contributed to the formation of the large coal deposits. During the Carboniferous, continents were covered by vast swamps, which inhibited the decomposition of dead trees. Additionally, animals and decomposing bacteria had not yet evolved enzymes to effectively digest the resistant phenolic lignin and waxy suberin polymers. Fungi that could break down those substances arose towards the end of the period, making subsequent coal formation much rarer.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_life_forms">The Carboniferous is famous for its vast rainforests of Lepidodendron, Sigillaria, and Calamites, which were the biggest rainforests in Earth’s history. Giant arthropods and insects appeared due to the high atmospheric oxygen levels and lack of predators. Terrestrial vertebrates became more abundant – amphibians became very diverse, and after the Carboniferous collapse reptiles started to prosper.</string>

    <string name="permian_physics">Mean temperature: 16 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 23%</string>
    <string name="permian_description">The Permian is the last period of the Paleozoic era. It ended with the largest mass extinction in Earth’s history. The world at the time was dominated by two continents known as Pangaea and Siberia, surrounded by a global ocean called Panthalassa. Vast deserts covered Western Pangea during the Permian, as reptiles spread across the face of the supercontinent.</string>
    <string name="permian_additional_title">Great Dying</string>
    <string name="permian_additional" formatted="false">The Permian – and the entire Paleozoic Era – ended 252 million years ago with the most severe mass extinction in Earth’s history. The Permian-Triassic extinction event, also known as the Great Dying, killed off 95% of all marine and 70% of all terrestrial species.\nIt affected marine environments badly: such marine groups like acanthodes, sea scorpions, trilobites (which had long been in decline), fusulinids, Tabulata and Rugosa corals were totally wiped out. It severely affected shelly marine animals, especially molluscs; it wiped out 96% of brachiopods, 97% of ammonites, 59% of bivalves, and 98% of gastropods.\nTerrestrial life was also profoundly affected, wiping out most large tetrapod species and 80% of insects. Paleozoic wet forests containing Sigillaria, Lepidodendron, Gigantopteris plants were devastated because of the arid climate and global fires.\nThere were several causes of this event:\n1. Hyperactive volcanism in the area now known as the Siberian traps. Volcanoes freed massive amounts of methane and hydrogen-sulfides into atmosphere, severely altering atmospheric chemistry.  Methane reacts with oxygen, so atmospheric oxygen plummeted from 30% to just 13%.  The gases also badly damaged the ozone layer; the resulting surge in UV radiation damaged terrestrial habitats. Finally, the surge in methane and other greenhouse gases resulted in a much hotter climate - Earth’s temperature mean rose by an incredible 8 degrees Celsius. \n2. The oceans suffered from massive deoxygenation – there was far less atmospheric oxygen to absorb, and the increase in temperature decreased absorption rates. The increased atmospheric sulfide caused a spike in ocean acidity. Acid disintegrates the carbonate shells of molluscs and corals, which is why so many of them died out. A surge in cyanobacteria and microbialites consumed much of the little oxygen that remained. In other words, oceans became vast, acidic, anoxic deserts, hostile to almost all existing marine life. \n3. Weakness in the Earth’s magnetic field caused an increase in solar radiation, so the extreme heat was repeatedly replace by exceptionally cold winters.\nThis event was so devastating, that Earth’s ecosystems did not recover their former diversity for 30 million years – not until the Middle Triassic. It selectively destroyed dominating Paleozoic organisms by wiping out 79% of their families and only 27% of the ones which will later thrive during the Mesozoic.</string>
    <string name="permian_life_forms">The Permian began with the Carboniferous flora still flourishing. In the Middle Permian a major transition in vegetation began. The swamp-loving lycopod trees, such as Lepidodendron and Sigillaria were progressively replaced by the more advanced seed ferns (like Glossopteris) and early conifers, gingkoes, and cycads.\nThe most successful insects were primitive relatives of cockroaches and early dragonflies. Early Permian terrestrial faunas were dominated by pelycosaurs and amphibians.  By the Middle Permian these gave way to primitive therapsids.  And in the Late Permian these were in turn replaced by more advanced therapsids, such as gorgonopsians. Towards the very end of the Permian, the first archosaurs appeared – a group that would give rise to the dinosaurs after the Great Dying. Also appearing at the end of the Permian were the first cynodonts, which would go on to evolve into mammals during the Triassic.</string>

    <string name="triassic_physics">Mean temperature: 17 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 16%</string>
    <string name="triassic_description">The Triassic began in the wake of Permian-Triassic extinction event, which left the Earth’s biosphere impoverished.  Life did not recover until the middle of this period.\nThe supercontinent of Pangea, mostly assembled by the Triassic, allowed land animals to migrate from the South Pole to the North Pole, and warm-water faunas spread across the Tethys Sea.</string>
    <string name="triassic_additional_title">The Nocturnal Bottleneck</string>
    <string name="triassic_additional">The nocturnal bottleneck hypothesis explains several mammal traits. This hypothesis states that mammals were mainly – or even exclusively – nocturnal through most of their evolutionary story, starting their origin 225 million years ago, and only ending with the demise of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. While some mammal groups have later evolved to fill diurnal niches, the 160 million years spent as nocturnal animals has left a lasting legacy on basal anatomy and physiology, and most mammals are still nocturnal.\nMammals evolved from cynodonts, a group of superficially dog-like reptiles, in the wake of the Permian-Triassic mass extinction. The emerging archosaurian groups that flourished after the extinction, including crocodiles and dinosaurs, drove the larger cynodonts into extinction, leaving only smaller forms. The surviving cynodonts could only succeed in niches with minimal competition from the diurnal dinosaurs, evolving into the typical small-bodied insectivorous dwellers of the nocturnal undergrowth.\nDespite the massive extinction at the end of the Cretaceous, mammals continued to be small-bodied for millions of years. While all the largest animals alive today are mammals, the majority of mammals are still small and nocturnal.\nThis hypothesis also explains why mammals became warm blooded, because at night temperatures are cooler, and their early burrowing lifestyle required more thermo-isolation.</string>
    <string name="triassic_life_forms">The Permian-Triassic extinction devastated both terrestrial and marine life. Biodiversity rebounded in the Triassic, as the surviving species repopulated empty terrain, but these were short lived. At first, 90% of the big terrestrial vertebrates belonged to a single genus of therapsids – Lystrosaurus – a sure sign that ecosystems were badly damaged as biodiversity was low. Diverse communities with complex food-web structures took another 30 million years to re-establish themselves. By the Middle Triassic, big therapsids were replaced by archosaurs (the ancestors of dinosaurs, crocodiles, and birds), and the dinosaurs began to establish themselves.\nSeed plants began to displace spores to dominate the terrestrial flora: in the northern hemisphere conifers, ferns, and bennettitales; and in the southern hemisphere Glossopteris trees.\nAs with other periods, this period ended with a mass extinction, which wiped out conodonts, most of the marine reptiles and invertebrates, and some remaining large therapsids and amphibians.</string>

    <string name="jurassic_description">The Jurassic is the second period of the Mesozoic era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The supercontinent of Pangea began to break apart in the Middle Jurassic. In the Late Jurassic the Central Atlantic Ocean was a narrow ocean separating Africa from North America. Eastern Gondwana had begun to separate from Western Gondwana.</string>
    <string name="jurassic_additional_title">Dinosaurian Prominence</string>
    <string name="jurassic_additional">About 20 million years after the Permian-Triassic extinction, dinosaurs diverged from their archosaurian ancestors and began to challenge the reigning archosauromorphs and therapsids. At first, they were not the dominant terrestrial animals, but after the Triassic-Jurassic extinction, which wiped out many of their competitors, they rose to prominence and occupied all the main niches for the next 135 million years.\nTwo main questions now are:\n1. How did some of the terrestrial dinosaurs become so massive? Most of the sauropods were huge – Argentinosaurus (weighing more than 100 tons), Mamenchisaurus, Diplodocus etc.\n2. Were dinosaurs feathered and warm blooded, or not?\nBoth of these questions are closely related, however there are still no clear answers.\nThe largest dinosaurs were herbivores, and a larger body is better protection against predators. In a crowded ecological space, herbivores may have evolved towards the only available unfilled niches – larger size – causing a “race to the top”, within the limits imposed by the physical environment and ecological capacity.\nThe largest sauropods grew incredibly fast – up to 5000 kg per year. Such growth rates require a very high metabolism, which is not usually observed in cold-blooded animals. However, a high metabolism (and warm blood) can become a disadvantage as body mass increases, as it requires more energy to heat – and to cool - larger volumes. Scientists now think that growing sauropods probably were warm-blooded, but their metabolism probably decreased as they approached their adult size.\nWe still have much to learn about dinosaurian physiology, but the traditional presentation of dinosaurs as cold blooded, lizard-like reptiles is giving way to a sense that most dinosaurs probably had some kind of thermoregulation. Recent dinosaur discoveries in North America provide evidence of at least seasonal dinosaurian presence in colder environments. And the latest discoveries of feathered velociraptors show that even large dinosaurs were feathered – likely even the notorious Tyrannosaurus Rex. The only dinosaurs that survived the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction – today’s birds – are feathered and warm blooded, so why not the larger Jurassic dinosaurs?</string>
    <string name="jurassic_life_forms">During the Jurassic period, the dominant marine vertebrates were fish and marine reptiles like ichthyosaurs (marine reptiles that resembled today’s dolphins), plesiosaurs (long-necked marine reptiles), pliosaurs (a version of the plesiosaur with a shorter neck and longer head), and crocodiles. Numerous turtles could be found in lakes and rivers.\nThe Jurassic was a golden age for the sauropods (large, long-necked herbivores like Diplodocus). During the Late Jurassic, the first avialans (bird-like dinosaurs), like Archaeopteryx, evolved.\nThe arid, continental conditions characteristic of the Triassic steadily eased during the Jurassic period. The warm, humid climate allowed lush jungles to cover much of the landscape. The conifers in particular dominated the flora.</string>

    <string name="cretaceous_description">The Cretaceous is the last period of the Mesozoic era, ending with a large mass extinction – the famous comet that destroyed the dinosaurs. It was a period with a relatively warm climate, resulting in high sea levels that created numerous shallow inland seas.\nDuring the Cretaceous the South Atlantic Ocean opened. India separated from Madagascar and raced northward on a collision course with Eurasia. Notice that North America was connected to Europe, and that Australia was still joined to Antarctica.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_additional_title">End of the Age of Dinosaurs</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_additional">The Cretaceous period ended with a massive extinction event, known as Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction. Numerous plant and animal species on Earth were wiped out, and all the non-avian dinosaurs became dead. With the exception of some cold-blooded species like turtles and crocodiles, no tetrapods weighing more than 25 kilograms survived. It marked the end of the Cretaceous period and with it, the entire Mesozoic Era, opening the Cenozoic Era that continues today.\nWhat could cause such a massive extinction? Now there are almost no disputes, that the cause of this event was a massive asteroid – 10-15 kilometers in diameter – falling near what is now Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. The consequences of this impact were of a planet-wide cataclysm. Dust blocked the sun for an entire year, preventing photosynthesis. Plant species died out, followed by the herbivores that fed on them and the carnivores that fed on the herbivores.  The asteroid also happened to strike a region of sulfur-rich carbonate rock, which caused higher ocean acidity.  As in the Great Dying, which ended the Paleozoic, the sharp increase in acidity wiped out many shelly marine animals, especially molluscs (like ammonites) and corals, and the animals that depended on them for food. The sea surface temperature dropped as much as 7 degrees Celsius for decades after the impact. It would take several hundred thousand years for Earth’s geochemistry to recover.\nThe sustained disruption killed all the reigning non-avian dinosaurs.  One interesting question is why the catastrophe did not wipe out the dinosaurs’ close relatives, the crocodilians. It is thought, that cold-blooded crocodiles have a much more limited need for food (they can survive months without eating) while warm-blooded animals of similar size need far more food (still more evidence that dinosaurs were likely warm-blooded, at least to some extent).\nThe elimination of the dominant Cretaceous groups allowed other organisms to take their place, spurring a remarkable series of adaptive radiations in Paleogene. The most striking example is the replacement of dinosaurs by mammals, who quickly diversified to fill the places left by the dinosaurs. In an important sense, therefore, the ultimate evolution of humans depended critically upon the extinction of the dinosaurs.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_life_forms">Flowering plants (angiosperms) appeared for the first time during the Cretaceous, however they did not become dominant until close to the end of the period. Their evolution was aided by the appearance of bees. In fact, angiosperms and insects are good examples of coevolution. The first representatives of many leafy trees, including figs, planes, and magnolias appeared in the Cretaceous.\nOn land, mammals were generally small in size, but an important component of the fauna. The apex predators were of course the archosaurian reptiles, especially dinosaurs, which were at their most diverse stage. Pterosaurs were common in the Early and Middle Cretaceous, but as the period proceeded, they declined (for reasons that are still poorly understood).\nInsects diversified during Cretaceous, with the appearance of ants, termites, butterflies and moths, aphids, grasshoppers, and gall wasps.\nIn the seas - rays, modern sharks, and bony fish became common. Marine reptiles included ichthyosaurs in the Early and Middle Cretaceous, with plesiosaurs and mosasaurs appearing before the end of the period.</string>

    <string name="paleogene_description">The Paleogene is the first period of the Cenozoic Era. This period consists of Paleocene, Eocene, and Oligocene epochs. The end of the Paleocene (about 55 million years ago) was marked by the Eocene Thermal Maximum, one of the most important periods of global change during the Cenozoic. The global climate during the Paleogene began a cooling and drying trend, periodically disrupted by warm periods. The trend was caused partially by the formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which significantly lowered oceanic water temperatures.\nDuring this time, India began to collide with Asia forming the Tibetan plateau and the Himalaya Mountains. Australia, which had been attached to Antarctica, began to move rapidly northward.</string>
    <string name="paleogene_additional_title">Eocene thermal maximum</string>
    <string name="paleogene_additional">The Eocene thermal maximum was a time period with 5-8 °C warmer global average temperature than today. This climate event began at the time boundary between the Paleocene and Eocene geological epochs around 55.5 million years ago.\nIt was propelled by two massive carbon injections, each lasting 1,500 years. The entire warm period lasted for about 200,000 years. The amount of carbon released during this time was more than 30 times larger than all the fossil fuels burned to date and equivalent to all the current fossil fuel reserves we have.\nThis event was probably caused by melting of seafloor methane ices (clathrates), or volcanism heating organic-rich rocks and releasing methane.\nThere was enhanced storminess in some areas (allusion to the modern storm regions of Caribbean and East Asia), increased aridity in tropical region and increased humidity closer to the poles. While there was significant ecological disruption, most species (except deep-sea foraminifera) were able to avoid extinction via adaptation or migration. First wave of modern mammals showed up, including ancestral primates, ungulates and cetaceans. Continent-scale migration of animals, and plants, ranges were shifted. Increased temperatures caused decrease in body size in mammalian species (dwarfism). There is a proposition, that under elevated carbon dioxide levels plants grow quickly, but are less nutritious than they normally would be. It might describe, why early horses experienced a body-size decrease of about 20-30%.\nThe rate at which carbon emissions warmed Earth’s climate resembles modern, human-caused global warming and can provide clues to the future of modern climate change.</string>
    <string name="paleogene_life_forms">Mammals began a rapid diversification during this period; some mammals evolved into large forms that would dominate on land, while others would adapt to marine life. Those that took to the oceans became modern cetaceans, while those that took to the trees became primates. Birds, which were already well established by the end of the Cretaceous, also experienced an adaptive radiation, as they took over skies free of the now-extinct pterosaurs. As the climate cooled, tropical plants became less numerous, and their range was restricted to equatorial regions.</string>

    <string name="neogene_physics">Mean temperature: 14 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 21.5%</string>
    <string name="neogene_description">The Neogene is a period that spans 20.45 million years. It is sub-divided into two epochs, the earlier Miocene and the later Pliocene. The Isthmus of Panama connected North and South America later in the Pliocene, cutting off the Atlantic Ocean from the warm ocean currents from the Pacific, and leaving only the Gulf Stream to transfer heat to the Arctic Ocean. The global climate cooled considerably over the course of the Neogene, culminating in a series of continental glaciations in the Quaternary period that follows.\n20 million years ago, Antarctica was covered by ice and the northern continents were cooling rapidly. The world has taken on a \"modern\" look, but notice that Florida and parts of Asia were under water.</string>
    <string name="neogene_additional_title">Cooler effect</string>
    <string name="neogene_additional">During the Neogene world became much drier and cooler, culminating disaster of the Pleistocene ice ages and the harsh conditions of our own day. During this interval, the relatively uniform and stable climatic regime which had cradled the world’s ecosystems for 200 million years, since the Late Triassic, came to a comparatively quick end. The drift of the continents had sealed off the waters of the far arctic, as the northern margins of Asia and North America crowded together. The closing of the Isthmus of Panama prevented warm currents from the Pacific to the Atlantic. In the south, Antarctica, now out of contact with any other landmass, was circled by a continuous circum-polar current. Perhaps for the first time since the Ordovician, both poles were thermally isolated from the warm equatorial waters and started accumulating heavy coverings of ice. The ice sheets, in turn reflected more sunlight and lowered sea levels, further reducing temperatures and warm-water circulation.\nThe world dried out, huge deserts developed in North Africa and Central Asia. The deep forests of the continental interiors were replaced by arid plains, steppe, prairie or tundra. Many herbivorous animal species died out or were forced to change together with their predators. By the end of the period, the world became similar to what we see now.</string>
    <string name="neogene_life_forms">During this period, mammals and birds continued to evolve into roughly modern forms, while other groups remained relatively unchanged. Early hominids, the ancestors of humans, appeared in Africa near the end of this period and later spread into Eurasia. Tropical plant species gave way to deciduous ones and grasslands replaced many forests. Grasses therefore greatly diversified, and herbivorous mammals evolved alongside it, creating the many grazing animals of today, such as horses and antelopes.</string>

    <string name="quaternary_description">The Quaternary Period is the current and most recent of the three periods of the Cenozoic Era. It is divided into two epochs: the Pleistocene and the Holocene (which began 11,700 years ago). The Quaternary is typically defined by the cyclic growth and decay of continental ice sheets driven by Milankovitch cycles and the associated climate and environmental changes that occurred. The last expansion of the polar ice sheets took place about 12,000 years ago.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_additional_title">Ice Age</string>
    <string name="quaternary_additional">The Quaternary is a period of the repeating glaciations, which are defined by the previously mentioned Milankovitch cycles. The angle of Earth’s axial tilt with respect to the orbital plane varies between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees over a cycle of about 41,000 years. The current tilt is 23.44 degrees, roughly halfway between its extreme values. Increased tilt increases the amplitude of the seasonal cycle, providing more solar radiation in each hemisphere’s summer and less in winter – in other words, climate at higher latitudes becomes warmer and stops glaciation. The tilt last reached its maximum 10,700 years ago and now is in the decreasing phase of its cycle and will reach its minimum in 9,800 years. The current trend of decreasing tilt will promote milder seasons, as well as an overall cooling trend. A new Ice Age is approaching.\nIn order to understand the impact of the glaciations, we should compare three regions at roughly the same latitude – China, North America, and Europe. Chinese flora is extremely rich, with million-year-old relics like Ginkgo, Magnolia, and Thujopsis. North America, too, has such ancient plants as Taxodium and Sequoiadendron.  Europe, however, has essentially no ancient plant groups at all (except for a few in the Mediterranean). Why is it that the Ice Ages affected plants in China and North America so differently from those in Europe?  The answer lies in geography.  Glaciations affect European plant life more severely: during the last glaciation, most of Europe was buried under ice and it was very difficult for Europe’s plants to escape southwards, because they were blocked by the Alps and Mediterranean Sea, both of which extend generally from east to west. (The Mediterranean region was able to retain some ancient plants like Platanus and Olea). North America, especially it’s eastern coastal region, was usually free of snow, and its mountains run generally north-south, making it easier for plants to retreat southward, away from the encroaching glaciers. China, in contrast, was not covered by glaciers at all. It’s hard to imagine that before the Quaternary, Europe was home to gingkoes and beautiful Magnolias.\nQuaternary glaciations also obstructed humans from migrating into Europe, and repeatedly destroyed the populations that did settle there.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_life_forms">The Quaternary is the modern period, and it represents our current fauna and flora. However, periodic glaciations had a huge impact on the terrestrial biota, frequently destroying plant and animal species. After the last ice age, many large Pleistocene mammals such as saber-tooth cats, mammoths, and mastodons became extinct worldwide.</string>

    <string name="future_physics">Mean temperature: x °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: y%</string>
    <string name="future_description">It is very hard to predict the future; however, we as an intelligent life forms can try to contemplate it. \nEarth will vanish eventually, because the Sun has its lifetime and will swallow our planet (unless our future siblings will be able to transfer Earth somewhere else). It is thought, that Earth’s habitable-zone lifespan is as long as 7.79 billion years. Because we already spent 4.56 billion years, we got around 3.23 billion years left, or even less – 1.75 billion years due to some scientists. It will get progressively hotter and there is nothing we can do about it. Sun converts hydrogen into helium and when the significant portion of it will be converted – it will undergo an internal change and become a Red Giant. This is how it is.\nBut it is an ideal case.</string>
    <string name="future_additional_title">Anthropogenic Future</string>
    <string name="future_additional" formatted="false">Life already showed it’s persistence and will to exist, so it will flourish with humans or without them. The current trends and risen concern in society about the ecology bring some optimism, because about 20 years ago people still believed EXXON lying about the non existent climate change and no one was thinking about the pollution etc. However, changes will occur anyway despite our wishes.\nThere is a hidden bomb in our understanding of the economy. Usually if country shows an economic growth of below the 3% it is portrayed as a slow growing one. But what does it mean to grow 3% per year? It basically means, that every 20 years economy doubles and current economy trends show, that with economic growth, energy consumption grows too. Since the industrial revolution we increased our energy consumption rates dramatically and we still use carbon-rich fossil fuel everywhere. Renewable energy still occupies just a tiny part of our produced energy.\nThe main law in physics states, that energy always emits heat – by the current calculations in 400 years we will need as much energy as the Sun provides and we will basically boil our oceans, if energy will be used as inefficiently as it is used today. And in 2000 years we will need energy of all the Milky Way galaxy stars. Now imagine Milky Way and its minimum diameter of 100,000 light years and ask yourself – is it possible to retain such consumption tempo?\nIt is more likely, that humanity will discover way more efficient energy sources and will adapt to live on Earth, because now humanity is trying to adapt Earth for life with people.\nAt the moment something similar to the Permian-Triassic extinction is happening now, but in faster rates. We dump tons of the carbon dioxide, Earth started to heat and already melts its polar caps, which contain massive amounts of trapped methane inside. Oceanic acidity had already risen during the recent years and it caused the partial death of the worldwide coral reefs, and anoxia is already spreading. Forests, which should fixate all the carbon dioxide are being cut for economic purposes. The sea levels will continue to rise. Such places like Florida, East Asia already suffer from the mass floods.\nCurrent events are driving Earth’s life towards the next mass extinction, however at least now it gather much more publicity and required attention.</string>

Typical unit consists of repeated thin layers of silver to black iron oxides, alternating with other iron-poor bands - red hematites.\nThe main hypothesis is that banded iron layers were formed in sea water as the result of oxygen released by photosynthetic cyanobacteria, that\'s why their occurrence in the Early Archean might show existence of life as early as 3.85 billion years ago.\nIt is assumed that initially Earth had vast amounts of iron dissolved in the world\'s seas. As photosynthetic organisms generated oxygen, the available iron precipitated as iron oxides and it contributed to these geological bodies.</string>

They exhibit a variety of forms and structures. Although stromatolites are usually associated with biological activity, some possess features that are more consistent with abiotic precipitation.\nPeak of their diversity was reached about 1.25 billion years ago and subsequently declined in abundance and diversity later. Modern stromatolites are rare and are mostly found in hypersaline lakes or marine lagoons where extreme conditions due to high saline levels prevent animal grazing.</string>

    <string name="devonian_prototaxites_description">Prototaxites is a genus of fungus, which formed large trunk-like structures up to 1 metre wide, reaching 8 metres in height. Although appearing in the Late Silurian, it reached its greatest diversity by the Devonian. Recent discovery of what are likely algal symbionts makes it a lichen, rather than a fungus in the strict sense.\nIt became extinct when the shrubs and vascular trees rose to prominence.</string>
    <string name="devonian_wattieza_description">Wattieza is a genus of the prehistoric tree (also the oldest one), that existed in the Middle Devonian and were close relatives of the modern ferns and horsetails. They could grow up to 8 m or more, furthermore they reproduced with spores.</string>
    <string name="devonian_archaeopteris_description">Archaeopteris is an extinct genus of tree-like plants with fern-like leaves, it could grow up to 10 metres in height and had trunks which exceeded 1.5 metres in diameter. It preferred wet soils, growing close to river systems and in flood plain woodlands. It is also a distant ancestor of the gymnosperm plants (like conifers).</string>
    <string name="devonian_tiktaalik_description">Although it looks like amphibian, Tiktaalik is a lobe-finned fish from the Late Devonian, having many features akin to those of tetrapods. Tiktaalik has a possibility of being a representative of the evolutionary transition from fish to amphibians. It is an example of the several lines of ancient sarcopterygian fish developing adaptations to the oxygen-poor shallow-water habitats – environmental conditions which are thought to have led to the evolution of tetrapods.\nIt is thought, that this animal was specialized for living in swampy, pond-like habitats and maybe occasionally it used its very specialized fins to move up overland.</string>
    <string name="devonian_ichthyostega_description">Ichthyostega is one of the first tetrapods in the fossil record that lived at the end of the Devonian. It possessed lungs and limbs that helped it navigate through shallow water in swamps. Although it looks like amphibian, it is still a stem group tetrapod and one of the closest amphibian ancestors. It had fish-like tail and gills, however it also had an amphibian skull and limbs.</string>
    <string name="devonian_bothriolepis_description">Bothriolepis is a widespread, abundant and diverse genus of placoderms, that was present during the Middle to Late Devonian period. Largest species could reach about 1 metre in length. It fed on detritus, algae and small microorganisms.</string>

    <string name="devonian_dunkleosteus_description">Dunkleosteus is an extinct genus of placoderm fish that existed during the Late Devonian. The largest species could grow up to 6 metres in length and weigh up to 1 tonne. It was a hypercarnivorous apex predator.\nDue to its heavily armoured exterior, Dunkleosteus was probably a relatively slow, but powerful swimmer.</string>
    <string name="devonian_acanthostega_description">Acanthostega is an extinct genus of stem-tetrapod and is among the first vertebrate animals to have recognizable limbs. It was anatomically intermediate form between lobe-finned fishes and those that were fully capable of coming onto land. It could grow up to 60 cm in length and had 8 digits on each hand linked by webbing. Acanthostega probably lived in shallow, weed-choked swamps and it was primarily an aquatic animal.</string>
    <string name="devonian_materpiscis_description">Materpiscis is a genus of placoderm fish which lived nearby Western Australia. Known from only one specimen, it is unique in having an unborn embryo present inside the mother, with remarkable preservation of a mineralised placental feeding structure. This makes Materpiscis the oldest known vertebrate to show viviparity, or giving birth to live young. It comprises only from the single species, which is called Materpiscis attenboroughi in honour of David Attenborough who first drew attention to significance of the Gogo fish sites in his 1979 series Life on Earth.</string>

It was a major component of the coal forest flora and sometimes reached over 30 metres in height, and had trunks over 1 m in diameter. It is estimated that these plants grew rapidly and lived 10&#8211;15 years. Most of the species were probably monocarpic, meaning that they reproduced only once toward the end of their life. By the Mesozoic era they were probably outcompeted by the emerging woody gymnosperms (ex. conifers).</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_sigillaria_description">Sigillaria is an extinct tree-like lycopsid, closely related to Lepidodendron. They could grow up to 30 metres in height and had a relatively short life cycle – growing rapidly and reaching maturity in a few years.</string>

    <string name="carboniferous_akmonistion_description">Akmonistion is a shark&#8211;like chimaera that lived during the Early Carboniferous. The male had an anvil-shaped crest instead of a dorsal fin. The crest had barbs on top and it also had a triangular patch of spines on top of its head in front of the crest. The female probably looked just like the male, except it might not have had the crest or the triangular patch of spines.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_helicoprion_description">Helicoprion is a long-lived genus of shark&#8211;like fish which had spirally arranged clusters of the individuals teeth. They could have grown up to 3&#8211;4 m in length with large specimens growing up to 7.5 m.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_pederpes_description">Pederpes is the earliest known tetrapod to show the beginnings of terrestrial locomotion.

    <string name="carboniferous_pulmonoscorpius_description">Pulmonoscorpius is a giant species of extinct scorpion, that could grow up to 70 centimetres long. The diet of Pulmonoscorpius is not known directly, but smaller arthropods may have formed part of its diet, and its sting may have been able to kill small tetrapods.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_arthropleura_description">Arthropleura is one of the largest known land invertebrates of all time, which had few, if any, predators. It could grow up to 2.3 metres in length and up to 50 centimetres in width. Arthropleura like other Carboniferous arthropods was able to grow larger due to the greater partial pressure of oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere, and because of the lack of large terrestrial vertebrate predators (that’s why during the Cretaceous there were no such arthropods, although oxygen levels were similar to the Carboniferous).\nIn contrary to the earlier and popular beliefs, Arthropleura was not a predator but a herbivorous arthropod.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_meganeura_description">Meganeura is an extinct genus of the giant dragonflies, which had a wingspan reaching up to 65 cm in length. Like Arthropleura, they could grow such big due to the greater atmospheric oxygen levels and lack of predators during that time.</string>

They lived in freshwater environment and probably hunted both fish and terrestrial prey (like the Nile crocodiles do).</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_microraptor_description">Microraptor was a genus of small, four-winged paravian dinosaurs. Their well-preserved fossils provide important evidence about the evolutionary relationship between birds and dinosaurs. It was among the most abundant non-avialan dinosaurs in its ecosystem. Adult specimens estimated up to 77 centimeters long and weighed up to 1 kilogram. Microraptor was an opportunistic predator, which hunted on small mammals, other bird-like dinosaurs and fish.</string>

    <string name="paleogene_titanoboa_description">Titanoboa is the largest known snake, which could reach 13 meters in length and weigh up to 1.2 tonnes. It mostly fed on fish and lived in the Paleocenian tropics.</string>
    <string name="paleogene_gastornis_description">Gastornis were very large birds that lived during the Late Paleocene and Eocene. They could grow up to 2 metres in height and have traditionally been considered to be predators of small mammals. However, several lines of evidence, including the lack of hooked claws in known Gastornis footprints and studies of their beak structure have caused scientists to reinterpret these birds as herbivores that probably fed on tough plant material and seeds.</string>
    <string name="paleogene_basilosaurus_description">Basilosaurus is a genus of the early whales that lived in the Late Eocene. Unlike modern whales, Basilosaurus was an apex predator.\nBelow you can see the currently known transitional whale evolution forms.</string>
    <string name="paleogene_paraceratherium_description">Paraceratherium is an extinct genus of hornless rhinoceros and one of the largest terrestrial mammals that has ever existed. Its height was about 4.8 metres, and the length about 7.4 metres, and weight is estimated to have been 15 to 20 tonnes.</string>
    <string name="paleogene_daeodon_description">Daeodon is an extinct genus of artiodactyl (elks, boars, bisons etc. are artiodactyls too) that inhabited North America during the Late Oligocene and Early Miocene epochs. They were around 1.8 m tall at the shoulders and had skulls about 90 cm long.</string>
    <string name="paleogene_pyrotherium_description">Pyrotherium is an extinct mammal genus related to the modern ungulates (like pigs, cattle, deers), that lived in Argentina during the Early Oligocene. They could weigh up to 3500 kg and were about 1.5 metres tall.</string>

    <string name="neogene_argentavis_description">Argentavis is among the largest flying birds ever to exist, having an estimated wing span of 5&#8211;6 meters, a height of 1.5&#8211;2 meters and a mass of approximately 70 kilograms. It probably preferred to scavenge for carrion.</string>
    <string name="neogene_ardipithecus_description">Ardipithecus might be one of the earliest ancestors of humans after they diverged from the main ape lineage, although it is still a matter of debate. It was very similar to chimpanzees and lived in the territory of the modern Ethiopia. Ardipithecus had a small brain, measuring between 300 and 350 cm3. This is slightly smaller than a modern chimpanzee brain and roughly 20% the size of the modern human brain. Nevertheless, it is in some ways unlike chimpanzees, suggesting that the common ancestor differs from the modern chimpanzee. After the chimpanzee and human lineages diverged, both underwent substantial evolutionary change. Chimp feet are specialized for grasping trees; Ardipithecus feet are better suited for walking.</string>
    <string name="neogene_megalodon_description">Carcharodon megalodon also known as megalodon is an extinct species of shark which lived almost until the end of the Neogene. It was one of the largest and most powerful predators in vertebrate history, reaching 18 metres in length. It is known, that they preyed on whales and fish. They extinct probably because of the multiple reasons, including the oceanic cooling, sea level drops and the decline in food supply.</string>
    <string name="neogene_levyatan_description">Livyatan is an extinct whale, similar in size to the modern sperm whale. It reached almost 18 meters in length and had powerful functional teeth in both of its jaws. It was an apex predator along with the giant megalodon. Its extinction was likely caused by a cooling event at the end of the Miocene which resulted in a drop in food populations. The formations where the whale has been found have also preserved a large assemblage of marine life, such as sharks and marine mammals.</string>
    <string name="neogene_titanis_description">Titanis walleri is a large extinct flightless carnivorous bird, which lived in the North America. It was about 2.5 meters tall and weighed approximately 150 kilograms. It is one of the famous terror birds, which were dominant predators in the early Cenozoic and Middle Cenozoic era.</string>
    <string name="neogene_deinotherium_description">Deinotherium was a large prehistoric relative of the modern-day elephants. They differed only by a shorter trunk, and it had downward curling tusks attached to the lower jaw. They could grow up to 4 meters tall and weigh about 12 tonnes.</string>

    <string name="quaternary_mammutus_description">Mammoths were large mammals, close elephant relatives covered by the long hair. Most of the mammoths were as large as the modern Asian elephants and lived in the northern hemisphere where colder climate was prevalent.\nThey fed on trees and shrubs. Mammoths vanished from Africa about 3&#8211;4 million years ago, from Europe and American mainland – about 10,000 years ago and some small populations survived almost until the recent days. The last known population lived in Wrangel island, until it died 3750 years ago.\nThe main cause of their extinction was the warming climate that occurred 12,000 years ago, accompanied by a glacial retreat, rising sea levels and diminishing of the plain tundra by the forests.\nCurrently, there are two separate projects in Japan and South Korea working towards recreating mammoth specimens from the DNA extracted from the frozen mammoths. Also, there is an ongoing project in the northeastern part of Russia called Pleistocene Park, where the russian scientist S. Zimov and his team are trying to prepare pasture for the possibly cloned mammoths. I really recommend watching a VICE documentary called “The Crazy Solution For Keeping The Melting Arctic Frozen”.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_coelodonta_description">Coelodonta is an extinct genus of woolly rhinoceros that lived in Eurasia almost until the recent days. Many species of Pleistocene megafauna, like woolly rhinoceros, became extinct around the same period. Human hunting is often cited as the possible cause of their extinction. Other extinction theories are associated with the climate change and the receding ice age. The last woolly rhinoceros population lived in Western Siberia about 10,000 years ago.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_megatherium_description">Megatherium was a genus of elephant-size ground sloths, that lived in South America. It weighed around 4 tonnes and measured up to 6 meters in length. It was adapted to temperate, arid or semi-arid open habitats. It fed on leaves such as yuccas, agaves and grasses. They died about 10,000 years ago because of the fragmentation of their habitats.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_smilodon_description">Smilodon is the best known as the saber tooth cat. It lived in the Americas almost until the recent days and could weigh almost 400 kilograms and grow up to 120 cm tall. They hunted large herbivores such as bisons and camels. They extinct together with the other large herbivores, because prey became smaller and more agile.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_coelacanth_description">Latimeria (or Coelacanth) is the oldest known living lobe-finned fish, known as the living fossil. They may live as long as 80 to 100 years and live as deep as 700 m below sea level. They feed on squids, small sharks and other fish. Scientists suspect one reason this fish has been so successful is that the specimens are able to slow down their metabolism at will. They live near the Sodwana Bay, South Africa.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_xiphosura_description">The Xiphosura, which includes the horseshoe crabs is the group, that hardly changed in millions of years and are considered to be the living fossils. They are related with another dominant Paleozoic arthropod group – trilobites. Their blood is very important for the modern medicine, because it is used for the detection of the bacterial endotoxins.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_ginkgo_description">Ginkgo is the only living species of the ancient plant division Ginkgophyta. It is found in fossils dating back 270 million years. Native to China, the tree is widely cultivated and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of food.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_welwitschia_description">Welwitschia is one of the three genus of the ancient plant division Gnetophyta. It grows in the Namib desert and is known as a living fossil. Many current individuals are over 1000 years old and some may be more than 2000 years old. Welwitschia produces a single pair of foliage leaves. Gnetophyta plants are relatives of the modern flowering plants.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_tuatara_description">Tuatara are reptiles endemic to New Zealand and the only alive specimens of the ancient reptile group – Rhynchocephalia, which flourished around 200 million years ago. They measure up to 80 cm and weigh up to 1.3 kg. They are terrestrial and nocturnal and thrive in much lower temperatures than those tolerated by most reptiles and hibernate during winter.\nNow they are extremely endangered because of the introduced rats and the habitat loss.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_human_description">Human or Homo sapiens is the most successful large vertebrate species to ever roam the Earth.  The estimated human population by the 2017 is around 7.5 billion and humans occupy most of the natural niches except the deep oceans, salt lakes, deep caves and Antarctica (although there are some specimens reported to live there, at least seasonally). It is currently deemed of “least concern” on the Red List of endangered species by the IUCN.\nTraditionally, there are two competing views of paleoanthropology about the origin of the H. sapiens: the recent African origin and the multiregional origin. More accepted single origin theory states, that modern humans appeared in East Africa and later migrated up north, when the glaciers retreated. They overwhelmed northern living H. neanderthalensis, which were already losing their genetic diversity and later migrated all around the world, by killing and destroying most of the natural habitats and animal species on their way. Later it became an apex, opportunistic predator, however different human populations specialized in different kind of food, for example: Japanese are regarded as the most ferocious marine predators, killing thousands of whales, dolphins, sharks and other sea animals each year; Chinese are known for their passion of killing rhinoceros, elephants and other horned animals, they even recently wiped out the Northern White Rhinoceros species in Africa, great job! European populations have depleted their natural resources long time ago, so they usually use other populations to bring them food and are best known for their manipulative skills and so on.\nThe human creating this application is about 1.83 meters long and weights about 69 kilograms, and is alive because of the photosynthesis.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_dodo_description">The dodo is an extinct flightless bird that was endemic to the island of Mauritius, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. It was about 1 metre tall and may have weighed up to 17 kg and is related to the pigeons. The dodo was historically been considered fat and clumsy, but it was well-adapted for its ecosystem. It used gizzard stones to help digest their food (mainly fruits).\nThe first recorded mention of the dodo was by Dutch sailors in 1598. In the following years, the bird was hunted by sailors and invasive species, while its habitat was being destroyed. The last widely accepted sighting of a dodo was in 1662. The extinction of the dodo within less than a century of its discovery called attention to the previously unrecognized problem of human involvement in the disappearance of entire species.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_megalania_description">Megalania is an extinct giant lizard and it was a part of a megafauna that inhabited southern Australia during the Pleistocene. The youngest fossil remains date around 50,000 years ago. The first aboriginal settlers of Australia might have encountered them and been a factor in their extinction. Largest individuals could grow up to 7 m long with a maximum weight of approximately 600&#8211;620 kg. It fed mostly upon medium to large sized animals and had a jaw full of serrated blade-like teeth.</string>
