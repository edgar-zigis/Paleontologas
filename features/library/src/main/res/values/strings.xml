    <string name="hadean_description">Hadean Eon – the earliest period of Earth\'s history, spanning from the planet\'s formation approximately 4.56 billion years ago until the emergence of stable tectonic plates around 4.0 billion years ago.\nThe landscape of the Early Hadean was extremely hostile, resembling a hellish environment. The surface was dominated by widespread volcanic activity, molten rock, and frequent bombardment by meteorites and comets.\nThe first 100 million years were far too inhospitable for any form of life, with surface temperatures reaching around 230 degrees Celsius—and in the earliest stages, even exceeding 2000 degrees Celsius. Atmospheric pressure was estimated to be about 27 times higher than today. While Earth possessed a primitive atmosphere, it was repeatedly stripped away by intense collisions with other celestial bodies.\nAround 4.4 billion years ago, the planet began to cool, as evidenced by zircon crystals, which suggest the presence of liquid water during this period. The end of the Hadean Eon is marked by the stabilization of Earth\'s crust, the formation of early oceans, and the beginnings of continental crust.</string>
    <string name="hadean_additional_title"></string>
    <string name="hadean_additional"></string>
    <string name="hadean_life_forms">There is no definitive proof that life could have existed in such a harsh environment. However, 4.1-billion-year-old graphite deposits found in Western Australia contain carbon isotopes that suggest possible biological origins, indicating that conditions for life may have been sustainable earlier than previously thought. Some scientists hypothesize that life may have emerged multiple times during the Hadean Eon, only to be repeatedly annihilated by catastrophic asteroid impacts and extreme volcanic activity. Additionally, carbon-rich meteorites, which delivered organic molecules to early Earth, support the idea that the building blocks of life may have originated in space.</string>

    <string name="archean_physics">Mean temperature: 45&#8211;70 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 0%</string>
    <string name="archean_description">The Archean Eon – the second eon in Earth\'s history – spans from approximately 4.0 billion years ago, when the first tectonic plates began to form, to around 2.5 billion years ago, just before the Great Oxidation Event.\nAt the beginning of this eon, Earth\'s temperature was 2–3 times higher than today. This was primarily due to a high concentration of greenhouse gases (dozens of times higher than today) and residual heat from planetary accretion and core formation.\nDuring this period, the Sun\'s luminosity was about 70–75% of its present level, leading to a \"faint young Sun paradox\", which was mitigated by the greenhouse effect. By the end of the Archean, Earth\'s tectonic activity had evolved into a more modern-like system, and vast oceans of liquid water covered much of the planet, providing the conditions for the emergence of early microbial life.</string>
    <string name="archean_additional_title">Late heavy bombardment</string>
    <string name="archean_additional">Around 4.0 billion years ago, the planets of our solar system, including Earth, experienced intense bombardment by large cosmic bodies for approximately 200 million years. This period, known as the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB), is evidenced by lunar samples collected by Apollo astronauts, which contain high-impact melt formations.\nExtrapolating lunar cratering rates to Earth at this time suggests that the planet would have experienced:\n1. Approximately 22,000 craters with diameters greater than 20 km.\n2. Around 40 craters with diameters exceeding 1,000 km.\n3. Several craters with diameters close to 5,000 km.\nThe prevailing hypothesis for this bombardment is that the giant planets – such as Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune – underwent orbital migration. This gravitational disturbance scattered objects from the asteroid and/or Kuiper belts into eccentric orbits, increasing the impact rate on the inner planets. This event may have delayed the emergence of life during the Early Archean by creating a hostile surface environment through frequent, high-energy impacts.</string>
    <string name="archean_life_forms">Unlike in the Hadean, the presence of life during the Archean is well established, though the exact timing of its emergence remains debated.\nThe earliest solid evidence of life comes from 3.48-billion-year-old stromatolites found in Australia. Additionally, 3.85-billion-year-old isotopic signatures in Greenland suggest biological activity, though their interpretation is contested.\nBanded iron formations (BIFs) also date back to this period. While some argue that their formation required oxygen from early photosynthetic microbes, others suggest alternative abiotic processes could have played a role.\nPossible early prokaryotes have been identified in Canadian rocks at least 3.77 billion years old, and lipid biomarker analysis suggests that the first eukaryotes may have emerged by the late Archean, around 2.7 billion years ago.</string>

    <string name="proterozoic_physics">Mean temperature: 5&#8211;45 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 0&#8211;12%</string>
    <string name="proterozoic_description">The Proterozoic Eon – the third major eon in Earth\'s history, spanning from approximately 2.5 billion to 541 million years ago, just before the widespread emergence of complex life. Key events of this eon include the transition to an oxygen-rich atmosphere during the Great Oxidation Event, multiple global glaciations (such as those associated with the Snowball Earth hypothesis during the Huronian, Sturtian, and Marinoan glaciations), and the evolution of early multicellular eukaryotic organisms, including soft-bodied life forms like those of the Ediacaran biota.\nThis is a hypothetical reconstruction of a Snowball Earth scenario during the Huronian and Cryogenian glaciations.</string>
    <string name="proterozoic_additional_title">Great Oxidation Event</string>
    <string name="proterozoic_additional">The Great Oxidation Event was the biologically induced rise of oxygen in Earth\'s atmosphere, occurring around 2.4 to 2.1 billion years ago. The widely accepted hypothesis states that the primary driver of this event was the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria.\nBefore this event, any free oxygen produced was rapidly consumed by chemical reactions with dissolved iron or organic matter. However, once these oxygen sinks became saturated, excess oxygen began accumulating in the atmosphere.\nFree oxygen is toxic to obligate anaerobic organisms, leading to a major extinction event. Additionally, atmospheric oxygen reacted with methane, a potent greenhouse gas, significantly lowering its concentration. This process likely triggered the Huronian glaciation, which lasted approximately 300 million years (from ~2.4 to ~2.1 billion years ago).\nThese profound changes in Earth\'s atmospheric and chemical cycles created new evolutionary pressures and opportunities. Life adapted first to tolerate and then to harness atmospheric oxygen, leading to the development of aerobic respiration. This metabolic breakthrough vastly increased the available energy supply, enabling the evolution of more complex, multicellular organisms.</string>
    <string name="proterozoic_life_forms">The Proterozoic Eon marks a crucial transition in the evolution of life, from simple unicellular organisms to more complex forms. During the Great Oxidation Event, many anaerobic organisms declined due to oxygen toxicity, while oxygen-tolerant and aerobic life forms, including early eukaryotic protists and bacteria, proliferated. By the mid-Proterozoic, stromatolites—microbial reef-like structures built by cyanobacteria—reached their peak diversity. During this time, the ancestors of fungi diverged from the ancestors of animals, marking an important evolutionary split within eukaryotes. By the Ediacaran Period (635–541 million years ago), the first complex, soft-bodied multicellular organisms had appeared, including members of the enigmatic Ediacaran biota, which represent some of the earliest known macroscopic life forms.</string>

    <string name="cambrian_physics">Mean temperature: 21 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 12.5%</string>
    <string name="cambrian_description">The Cambrian Period was the first geological period of the Paleozoic Era and marked a profound transformation in life on Earth. Before the Cambrian, most living organisms were microscopic and relatively simple. However, the Cambrian saw an unprecedented diversification of life in an event known as the Cambrian Explosion. During this time, many major animal phyla first appeared in the fossil record, and complex ecosystems emerged.\nThe great glaciers of the late Proterozoic Eon had long melted, leading to high sea levels that flooded vast areas of continents with warm, shallow seas—an ideal environment for marine life. The Earth was generally cool during the Early Cambrian, likely due to the supercontinent Gondwana covering the South Pole, which disrupted polar ocean currents. However, global temperatures were still around 7°C higher than today. While polar ice caps and glaciations may have existed, the climate gradually warmed toward the end of the period. Glaciers retreated, sea levels rose dramatically, and this warming trend continued into the Ordovician Period.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_additional_title">The Cambrian Explosion</string>
    <string name="cambrian_additional">The Cambrian Explosion was a relatively brief evolutionary event, during which approximately 63% of all biological classes and most of the major modern animal phyla first appeared. This period saw the emergence of complex ecosystems, with the development of burrowing behaviors and the widespread diversification of skeletonized animals, which were previously absent or rare.\nPossible causes of this evolutionary event:\n1. Increased atmospheric oxygen levels, which supported larger and more complex organisms.\n2. The formation of an ozone layer, reducing the harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and enabling life to thrive in shallower waters.\n3. The Snowball Earth events during the late Proterozoic, which led to mass extinctions and opened up ecological niches for new life forms.\n4. Higher calcium concentrations in Cambrian seawater, allowing marine organisms to develop skeletons, shells, and other hard body structures.\n5. Developmental changes, including the evolution of Hox genes, which played a key role in organizing body plans and enabling more complex organisms to form.\n6. Changes in the food web, leading to coevolution and predator-prey “arms races” that drove anatomical and behavioral innovations.\nThe Cambrian was also a time of evolutionary experimentation, resulting in many bizarre and unique body plans, some of which have no modern descendants.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_life_forms">Most animal life during the Cambrian was aquatic. Arthropods were by far the most dominant animals in the ocean, with trilobites being particularly abundant. This period also saw the emergence of many new mineralized organisms, as well as the first widespread burrowing animals, which played a key role in reshaping seafloor ecosystems. However, unlike in modern times, most animals lived on or near the sea floor, with very few swimming or pelagic species.</string>

    <string name="ordovician_physics">Mean temperature: 16 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 13.5%</string>
    <string name="ordovician_description">The Ordovician is the second of six periods of the Paleozoic Era. During this period, ancient oceans separated the largely barren continents of Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia, and the supercontinent Gondwana. The Ordovician saw a great diversification of marine life, including the rise of early corals, cephalopods, and the first jawless fish. However, the period ended with one of the most severe ice ages in Earth’s history, leading to the second-largest mass extinction, which wiped out around 85% of marine species. Ice sheets covered much of the southern region of Gondwana, dramatically altering global sea levels and climate.</string>
    <string name="ordovician_additional_title">Ordovician Radiation</string>
    <string name="ordovician_additional">The Ordovician period is notable for the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE), a time of rapid biological diversification that replaced the distinctive Cambrian fauna with a Paleozoic fauna rich in suspension feeders and pelagic animals. This event followed the Cambrian-Ordovician extinction, which was likely caused by a sudden glaciation and a depletion of available oxygen in the oceans.\nThe primary driver of the Ordovician radiation was a major shift in paleogeography. Due to high sea levels, continents became highly fragmented into distinct marine provinces, fostering regional biodiversity. Intense orogeny (mountain-building events), along with increased erosion, contributed to high ecosystem productivity by delivering abundant nutrients into the oceans.\nWhile the Cambrian Explosion was crucial in establishing most modern animal phyla, the GOBE can be seen as the event that diversified these phyla into modern classes and lower-level taxa, significantly shaping marine ecosystems that would persist for millions of years.</string>
    <string name="ordovician_life_forms">Life during the Ordovician continued to flourish, with an explosion of marine biodiversity, including the rise of the first coral reefs, trilobites, brachiopods, mollusks, and the first true vertebrates—jawless fish. However, the period ended with a catastrophic mass extinction at the boundary with the Silurian. This extinction was primarily driven by severe global cooling, glaciation, and associated sea-level changes. Despite this, the fauna that emerged and thrived during the Ordovician laid the foundation for marine ecosystems throughout the remainder of the Paleozoic Era.</string>

    <string name="silurian_physics">Mean temperature: 17 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 14%</string>
    <string name="silurian_description">The Silurian is a relatively short geological period, lasting approximately 24 to 28 million years. During this time, Laurentia collided with Baltica, closing the northern branch of the Iapetus Ocean and forming the "Old Red Sandstone" continent. Coral reefs thrived, becoming more widespread and diverse, and the first vascular land plants began to colonize the previously barren continents, marking a significant evolutionary step in the history of life on land.</string>
    <string name="silurian_additional_title">Terrestrial plant diversification</string>
    <string name="silurian_additional">The evolutionary appearance of vascular plants dramatically altered Earth\'s environment, paving the way for animal life on land and fundamentally changing Earth\'s atmosphere. Interestingly, plant evolution progressed much faster than animal evolution: during the Late Silurian, plants were structurally simple and small, but by the end of the Devonian (approximately 46 million years later), almost all present-day plant lineages (except flowering plants) had emerged.\nOne possible explanation is that adapting to terrestrial life posed a greater challenge for plants than for animals. At the level of the individual organism, all plants (except parasitic ones) must perform four essential functions to grow and survive:\n1. Intercept sunlight.\n2. Exchange atmospheric gases with the environment.\n3. Acquire, transport, and conserve water.\n4. Cope with external mechanical forces.\nThese tasks are interdependent and often conflict with one another. For example: a) Increasing surface area to capture more sunlight and facilitate gas exchange can reduce water conservation. b) Positioning leaves horizontally to maximize light interception increases mechanical stress.\nAquatic environments are relatively uniform and stable, while terrestrial environments are affected by wind, temperature changes, unpredictable precipitation, and varying sunlight. Adapting to diverse terrestrial conditions required innovative solutions for each of the basic functions, leading to significant diversification in plant body forms.\nAdditionally, greater exposure to ultraviolet light above the wate\'s surface likely caused more mutations, accelerating evolutionary changes. However, the theory of plant fitness – how well plants adapted to the challenges of terrestrial life – best explains the rapid evolution of land plants.</string>
    <string name="silurian_life_forms">Multicellular life began to appear on land in the form of small, bryophyte-like and early vascular plants that grew near lakes, streams, and coastlines. The Silurian period also marked the first appearance of arthropods on land, including primitive millipedes and arachnids. However, terrestrial life would not significantly diversify or impact the landscape until the Devonian period.\nA major evolutionary milestone during the Silurian was the diversification of bony fishes (Osteichthyes), which began to dominate marine ecosystems. This diversification laid the foundation for the evolution of many modern fish lineages.</string>

    <string name="devonian_physics">Mean temperature: 20 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 15%</string>
    <string name="devonian_description">The Devonian is the fourth of the six periods of the Paleozoic era. It was a relatively warm period, though occasionally disrupted by glaciations. The climate was generally arid, particularly near the equator. During this time, the Early Paleozoic oceans were gradually closing, leading to the formation of a “pre-Pangea” supercontinent. This continental configuration allowed fish to migrate from the southern hemisphere continents to North America and Europe. For the first time, extensive forests appeared in the equatorial regions of what is now Arctic Canada. The period concluded with the Late Devonian extinction, which resulted in the loss of about 50% of all genera, significantly impacting marine life, including many fish and reef-building organisms.</string>
    <string name="devonian_additional_title">The Late Devonian extinction</string>
    <string name="devonian_additional" formatted="false">The Late Devonian extinction was one of the five major extinction events in Earth\'s history. Rather than being a single event, it consisted of a series of two major crises known as the Kellwasser and Hangenberg events. It is estimated that around 75% of all animal species disappeared during this time. The extinction primarily affected marine life, severely impacting groups such as brachiopods, trilobites, and reef-building organisms, which almost completely collapsed. Major fish groups like Placodermi, Heterostraci, and Anaspida were completely wiped out. The extinction event destroyed approximately 97% of all vertebrate species, with only smaller forms surviving. In the aftermath, no sharks larger than a meter and almost no fishes or tetrapods larger than 10 centimeters remained, and it would take around 10 million years before they began to increase in size again. However, despite its catastrophic impact, the Late Devonian extinction crucially paved the way for the evolution of modern vertebrate fauna, including actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes), chondrichthyans (cartilaginous fishes), and tetrapods.\nThe crash in biodiversity during the Late Devonian was more drastic than the famous mass extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous.\nThe causes of this extinction event remain uncertain. Some proposed explanations include:\n1. An asteroid impact.\n2. Evolutionary changes in plants, particularly the development of root systems, which led to massive water eutrophication and subsequent anoxia.\n3. A reduction in atmospheric carbon dioxide, causing global cooling.\n4. Increased magmatism and volcanic activity.</string>
    <string name="devonian_life_forms">Free-sporing vascular plants began to spread across dry land during the Devonian period, covering the continents with extensive forests. By the Middle Devonian, several groups of plants had evolved leaves and true roots, marking significant advancements in plant evolution. Groups such as lycophytes, equisetophytes, and pteridophytes diversified, forming the first complex terrestrial ecosystems.\nFish achieved remarkable diversity during this time, earning the Devonian the nickname “Age of Fish”. Placoderms, armored prehistoric fish, were the most dominant group. The ancestors of tetrapods, particularly lobe-finned fish, began to adapt to walking on land, as their robust pectoral and pelvic fins gradually evolved into legs. These transitional species paved the way for the later evolution of amphibians.\nThe first ammonites (a group of molluscs) appeared, marking an important diversification of marine life. Trilobites and large coral reef systems remained common, with one notable now-dry barrier reef, located in what is now the Kimberley Basin of Northwest Australia, once extending approximately a thousand kilometers.</string>

    <string name="carboniferous_physics">Mean temperature: 14 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 32.5%</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_description">The name "Carboniferous" means “coal-bearing,” referring to the extensive coal deposits formed during this period. In the Early Carboniferous, the Paleozoic oceans between Euramerica and Gondwana began to close, giving rise to mountain ranges such as the Appalachians and the Variscans. A large ice cap developed over the South Pole, while lush, tropical coal swamps near the Equator supported the evolution of four-legged vertebrates (tetrapods) and the first winged insects.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_additional_title">Carboniferous collapse and coal</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_additional">The Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse was a significant ecological event that occurred around 305 million years ago. It disrupted the vast coal forests that once covered the equatorial region, fragmenting them into isolated patches. This fragmentation led to dwarfism and the eventual extinction of many plant and animal species.\nThe collapse resulted in the extinction of dominant lycopsid trees and a shift toward ecosystems dominated by more opportunistic plants like tree ferns. Before the event, animal species were distributed widely across the forests, but afterward, each isolated “island” of rainforest developed its own unique mix of species—this process is known as endemism.\nOxygen levels reached a record high of approximately 32.5% during the Carboniferous, allowing enormous arthropods like Meganeura (a giant dragonfly-like insect) and Arthropleura (a giant millipede-like arthropod) to thrive. However, following the rainforest collapse, oxygen levels declined, leading to the extinction of many of these giants. The increasingly arid climate also caused a mass decline in amphibian diversity, opening ecological space for reptiles to diversify—organisms better suited to dry environments.\nSeveral hypotheses have been proposed to explain the collapse, with the most widely accepted being climate aridification and increased volcanic activity.\nThis event also played a role in the formation of large coal deposits. During the Carboniferous, extensive swamp forests prevented the full decomposition of dead plant material. At the time, few animals or microbes had evolved enzymes to break down tough substances like phenolic lignin and waxy suberin. Fungi capable of decomposing these materials appeared only toward the end of the period, which is one reason why massive coal formation is largely limited to the Carboniferous.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_life_forms">The Carboniferous is renowned for its vast tropical rainforests dominated by towering plants like Lepidodendron, Sigillaria, and Calamites—some of the largest and most extensive forests in Earth’s history. Giant arthropods and insects thrived during this time, aided by high atmospheric oxygen levels and the absence of effective predators. Terrestrial vertebrates became increasingly abundant: amphibians diversified greatly, and following the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse, reptiles began to flourish due to their better adaptation to drier environments.</string>

    <string name="permian_physics">Mean temperature: 16 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 23%</string>
    <string name="permian_description" formatted="false">The Permian was the final period of the Paleozoic Era, it ended with the most extensive mass extinction in Earth’s history, wiping out approximately 90% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial species. During this time, most of the world\'s landmasses were joined into two large continents—Pangaea and Siberia—surrounded by a vast global ocean called Panthalassa. Western Pangaea was dominated by arid deserts, while reptiles, including early ancestors of mammals, diversified and spread widely across the supercontinent.</string>
    <string name="permian_additional_title">Great Dying</string>
    <string name="permian_additional" formatted="false">The Permian and the entire Paleozoic Era ended 252 million years ago with the most severe mass extinction in Earth\'s history. The Permian-Triassic extinction event, also known as the Great Dying, wiped out about 95% of all marine species and 70% of all terrestrial species.\nMarine environments were hit particularly hard. Entire groups such as acanthodians (spiny sharks), sea scorpions, trilobites (already in decline), fusulinids, and Tabulata and Rugosa corals became completely extinct. Shelled marine animals were severely affected – 96% of brachiopod species, 97% of ammonites, 59% of bivalves, and 98% of gastropods perished.\nTerrestrial ecosystems also suffered enormously. Most large tetrapods disappeared, and around 80% of insect species were lost. Paleozoic wet forests, once dominated by ancient plants like Sigillaria, Lepidodendron, and Gigantopteris, were devastated due to widespread aridification and intense wildfires.\nSeveral interlinked causes contributed to this catastrophe:\n1. Massive volcanic eruptions in the region now known as the Siberian Traps released enormous quantities of carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrogen sulfide. These gases drastically altered atmospheric chemistry. Methane reacted with atmospheric oxygen, reducing oxygen levels from 30% to around 13%. The ozone layer was damaged, exposing the surface to harmful ultraviolet radiation. This led to a rapid increase in global temperatures—by as much as 8°C.\n2. Oceans became dangerously deoxygenated. Warmer temperatures reduced oxygen absorption, and toxic gases led to acidification. Acidic water dissolved the calcium carbonate shells of mollusks and corals, leading to their mass extinction. The proliferation of cyanobacteria and microbial mats further consumed what little oxygen remained, turning the seas into anoxic, acidic, nearly lifeless zones.\n3. A temporary weakening of Earth\'s magnetic field may have allowed increased solar radiation to reach the surface, creating extreme seasonal swings with scorching summers followed by bitterly cold winters.\nThe devastation was so profound that ecosystems took over 30 million years to recover their former diversity—not until the Middle Triassic. The extinction selectively eliminated dominant Paleozoic life forms, erasing 79% of their families, while only 27% of the lineages that would come to thrive in the Mesozoic were affected.</string>
    <string name="permian_life_forms">The Permian began with Carboniferous-era plant life still thriving. In the Middle Permian, a major shift in vegetation occurred: swamp-loving lycopod trees such as Lepidodendron and Sigillaria were gradually replaced by more advanced seed ferns like Glossopteris, along with early conifers, ginkgoes, and cycads.\nInsects during this time were dominated by primitive relatives of cockroaches and early dragonflies. Early Permian terrestrial ecosystems were populated by pelycosaurs (sail-backed synapsids like Dimetrodon) and large amphibians. By the Middle Permian, these groups declined and were succeeded by primitive therapsids – mammal-like reptiles. In the Late Permian, more advanced therapsids such as gorgonopsians emerged, becoming top predators.\nToward the very end of the Permian, the first archosaurs appeared—a group that would later evolve into dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and crocodiles. Also emerging in this period were the earliest cynodonts, small therapsids that would eventually give rise to mammals in the Triassic.</string>

    <string name="triassic_physics">Mean temperature: 17 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 16%</string>
    <string name="triassic_description">The Triassic began in the aftermath of the Permian-Triassic extinction event, the most severe extinction in Earth\'s history, which left the biosphere severely impoverished. Life began to recover significantly only by the middle of the Triassic period. \nDuring this time, the supercontinent Pangea was largely assembled, enabling land animals to migrate freely from the South Pole to the North Pole. Additionally, warm-water marine species spread across the vast Tethys Sea, supporting a resurgence of biodiversity in the oceans.</string>
    <string name="triassic_additional_title">The Nocturnal Bottleneck</string>
    <string name="triassic_additional">The nocturnal bottleneck hypothesis explains several unique traits of mammals. According to this hypothesis, mammals were primarily—or even exclusively—nocturnal for most of their early evolutionary history, beginning around 225 million years ago during the Late Triassic and continuing until the extinction of the dinosaurs around 65 million years ago. While some mammal groups later adapted to daytime (diurnal) activity, the approximately 160 million years spent in nocturnal niches left a lasting legacy on their anatomy and physiology. As a result, many mammals today retain nocturnal habits.\nMammals evolved from cynodonts, a group of mammal-like reptiles with dog-like features, in the aftermath of the Permian-Triassic mass extinction. Following this extinction, archosaurian reptiles—including ancestors of crocodiles and dinosaurs—rapidly diversified and came to dominate most ecological roles. This competition pushed the larger cynodonts toward extinction, leaving only smaller, more adaptable forms.\nThese surviving cynodonts likely occupied nocturnal, insect-eating niches with less competition from the dominant, diurnal dinosaurs. Over time, they evolved into early mammals—small-bodied, warm-blooded, and adapted to life in the undergrowth.\nEven after the extinction of the dinosaurs, mammals remained small for millions of years. Although mammals now include many large species, most are still relatively small and active at night.\nThe nocturnal bottleneck hypothesis also offers a compelling explanation for the evolution of mammalian warm-bloodedness (endothermy): cooler nighttime temperatures and burrowing lifestyles would have favored efficient internal temperature regulation and insulation.</string>
    <string name="triassic_life_forms">The Permian-Triassic extinction devastated both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Although biodiversity began to rebound during the Triassic, early recovery stages were dominated by only a few resilient species. For example, up to 90% of large terrestrial vertebrates initially belonged to a single genus of therapsids—Lystrosaurus—highlighting the severe ecological damage and lack of biodiversity. Complex ecosystems with diverse food webs took nearly 30 million years to fully re-establish.\nBy the Middle Triassic, large therapsids had largely disappeared, and archosaurs—relatives of modern crocodiles, birds, and ancestors of dinosaurs—became the dominant land vertebrates. Dinosaurs began to diversify and gradually establish their dominance by the end of the period.\nOn land, seed plants became increasingly dominant over spore-bearing plants. In the Northern Hemisphere, conifers, ferns, and bennettitales thrived, while in the Southern Hemisphere, Glossopteris trees initially remained prominent before disappearing later in the period.\nLike other geological periods, the Triassic ended with a mass extinction. This event led to the disappearance of conodonts (a group of jawless marine vertebrates), many marine reptiles and invertebrates, and some remaining large therapsids and amphibians.</string>

    <string name="jurassic_physics">Mean temperature: 16.5 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 26%</string>
    <string name="jurassic_description">The Jurassic is the second period of the Mesozoic Era, often called the Age of Reptiles. During the Middle Jurassic, the supercontinent Pangaea began to break apart. By the Late Jurassic, the Central Atlantic Ocean had formed as a narrow sea separating Africa from North America. Additionally, Eastern Gondwana had started to drift away from Western Gondwana. This tectonic activity helped shape the continents as we know them today and influenced global climates and ecosystems.</string>
    <string name="jurassic_additional_title">Dinosaurian Prominence</string>
    <string name="jurassic_additional">About 20 million years after the Permian-Triassic extinction, dinosaurs evolved from their archosaurian ancestors and began to compete with the dominant archosauromorphs and therapsids. Initially, they were not the leading terrestrial animals. However, after the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event—which eliminated many of their competitors—dinosaurs rose to dominance and filled most major ecological niches for the next 135 million years.\nTwo major questions remain:\n1. How did some terrestrial dinosaurs grow to such massive sizes? Many sauropods, such as Argentinosaurus (estimated at over 70 tons), Mamenchisaurus, and Diplodocus, were enormous.\n2. Were dinosaurs feathered and warm-blooded?\nThese two questions are closely related, but still not fully resolved.\nThe largest dinosaurs were herbivores, and large body size likely provided protection from predators. In crowded ecosystems, herbivores may have evolved toward unoccupied ecological niches—especially larger size—creating an evolutionary “arms race” toward gigantism, within the constraints of physics and environment.\nFossil evidence shows that sauropods grew at astonishing rates—up to 5,000 kg per year. Such rapid growth suggests a high metabolic rate, unlike that of modern cold-blooded animals. However, high metabolism can become a disadvantage for very large animals, as heating and cooling large volumes of tissue becomes energetically costly. Current research suggests that juvenile sauropods were likely warm-blooded, but their metabolic rate may have decreased as they matured.\nOur understanding of dinosaur physiology continues to evolve. The outdated view of dinosaurs as sluggish, cold-blooded reptiles has largely been replaced by the idea that many species had active metabolisms and some form of thermoregulation. Fossil evidence from North America suggests some dinosaurs lived seasonally in cold climates. The discovery of feathered dinosaurs—including large species like Velociraptor and possibly even Tyrannosaurus rex—supports the theory that feathers were common among theropods. The only dinosaurs to survive the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction—modern birds—are both feathered and warm-blooded. This raises a compelling question: why wouldn’t many Jurassic dinosaurs share these traits?</string>
    <string name="jurassic_life_forms">During the Jurassic period, the dominant marine vertebrates were fish and a variety of marine reptiles, including ichthyosaurs (marine reptiles that resembled modern dolphins), plesiosaurs (long-necked, paddle-limbed swimmers), pliosaurs (a group of plesiosaurs with shorter necks and larger heads), and marine-adapted crocodilians. Numerous turtles inhabited freshwater environments such as lakes and rivers.\nThe Jurassic was a golden age for sauropods—gigantic, long-necked herbivores like Diplodocus, Brachiosaurus, and Apatosaurus. It also saw the appearance of the first avialans (early bird-like dinosaurs), including the famous Archaeopteryx, which had feathers and could likely glide or make short powered flights.\nThe arid, continental conditions that characterized the Triassic gradually gave way to a more humid and tropical climate during the Jurassic. This warmer, wetter environment allowed dense forests and lush vegetation to spread. Conifers, along with cycads, ginkgoes, and ferns, dominated the plant life.</string>

    <string name="cretaceous_description">The Cretaceous was the final period of the Mesozoic Era, ending about 66 million years ago with a massive mass extinction — famously caused by an asteroid impact that contributed to the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs. This period was characterized by a relatively warm global climate and high sea levels, which formed vast shallow inland seas.\nDuring the Cretaceous, the South Atlantic Ocean began to open as South America and Africa drifted apart. India separated from Madagascar and moved rapidly northward toward a future collision with Eurasia — a movement that would eventually form the Himalayas. North America was still connected to Europe at times, and Australia remained attached to Antarctica.\nThe Cretaceous also saw the diversification of flowering plants (angiosperms), which began to transform ecosystems and food chains. Many modern insect groups appeared, co-evolving with these plants. In the oceans, large marine reptiles like mosasaurs thrived, while the skies were dominated by pterosaurs and early birds.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_additional_title">End of the Age of Dinosaurs</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_additional">The Cretaceous Period ended with a massive extinction event, known as the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) extinction. Numerous plant and animal species were wiped out, including all non-avian dinosaurs. With the exception of some cold-blooded species like turtles and crocodilians, no tetrapods weighing more than 25 kilograms are known to have survived. This event marked the end of both the Cretaceous Period and the entire Mesozoic Era, ushering in the Cenozoic Era that continues to this day.\nWhat could cause such a devastating extinction? Today, there is overwhelming scientific consensus that the main cause was a massive asteroid — approximately 10 to 15 kilometers in diameter — that struck near what is now Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula. The impact triggered global catastrophe: debris and dust ejected into the atmosphere blocked sunlight for months to years, halting photosynthesis. As a result, plant life collapsed, followed by the extinction of herbivores and then carnivores higher up the food chain.\nThe asteroid struck a region rich in sulfur-containing carbonate rock, releasing sulfur aerosols and causing acid rain and ocean acidification. This sharp drop in pH levels devastated marine ecosystems, wiping out many shell-forming organisms like ammonites and corals, along with the animals that fed on them. Sea surface temperatures fell by as much as 7°C, and it took hundreds of thousands of years for Earth’s climate and ecosystems to recover.\nOne intriguing question is why some of the dinosaurs’ close relatives, like crocodilians, survived. It is believed that their cold-blooded metabolism and ability to survive long periods without food helped them endure the harsh post-impact conditions — further evidence that non-avian dinosaurs were likely warm-blooded, at least to some extent.\nThe elimination of dominant Cretaceous species opened ecological niches for new life forms. This led to a remarkable period of adaptive radiation in the Paleogene. The most striking example is the rise of mammals, which quickly diversified to occupy roles previously held by dinosaurs. In a profound sense, the eventual evolution of humans may have depended on the extinction of the dinosaurs.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_life_forms">Flowering plants (angiosperms) first appeared during the Cretaceous, though they did not become ecologically dominant until the latter part of the period. Their evolution was closely tied to the emergence of pollinating insects, especially bees. In fact, angiosperms and insects are classic examples of coevolution — each influencing the evolution of the other. The Cretaceous also saw the first appearances of many modern leafy trees, such as figs, plane trees, and magnolias.\nOn land, mammals were typically small, but they were a vital part of the ecosystem. The dominant terrestrial predators remained archosaurian reptiles — especially dinosaurs, which reached their peak in diversity during this time. Pterosaurs were widespread in the Early and Middle Cretaceous, though their diversity declined later in the period for reasons that remain unclear.\nInsects underwent a significant diversification during the Cretaceous, with the emergence of many modern groups including ants, termites, butterflies and moths, aphids, grasshoppers, and gall wasps.\nIn the oceans, rays, modern sharks, and bony fishes became increasingly common. Marine reptiles included ichthyosaurs, which thrived in the Early and Middle Cretaceous, and later plesiosaurs and mosasaurs, which rose to prominence before the end of the period.</string>

    <string name="paleogene_description">The Paleogene is the first period of the Cenozoic Era and includes the Paleocene, Eocene, and Oligocene epochs. The end of the Paleocene (around 55 million years ago) was marked by the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), one of the most significant global warming events of the Cenozoic. This event caused rapid increases in temperature, major shifts in ecosystems, and the extinction of many deep-sea species.\nThroughout the Paleogene, Earth’s climate gradually cooled and dried, though this trend was occasionally interrupted by short-lived warming events. One major factor contributing to the cooling was the formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which thermally isolated Antarctica and significantly cooled ocean waters.\nDuring this period, the Indian subcontinent began colliding with Asia, giving rise to the Himalayan Mountains and the Tibetan Plateau. Australia, previously connected to Antarctica, started drifting northward, eventually influencing the formation of unique ecosystems like those found today.</string>
    <string name="paleogene_additional_title">PETM</string>
    <string name="paleogene_additional">The Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) was a period when global average temperatures were 5–8°C warmer than today. This major climate event began around 55.5 million years ago, at the boundary between the Paleocene and Eocene epochs.\nIt was triggered by two massive releases of carbon into the atmosphere, each lasting approximately 1,500 years. In total, the PETM lasted about 200,000 years. The amount of carbon released during this period was more than 30 times greater than all fossil fuels burned to date and comparable to the total known fossil fuel reserves.\nThe likely causes of this carbon surge include the melting of methane clathrates (frozen methane on the ocean floor) and volcanic activity heating organic-rich sediments, releasing large amounts of methane.\nThis warming led to increased storminess in some areas (similar to today’s Caribbean and East Asia), higher aridity in tropical regions, and greater humidity near the poles. While ecosystems were severely disrupted, most species—except deep-sea foraminifera—survived by adapting or migrating. This period also saw the rise of many modern mammal groups, including early primates, hoofed mammals (ungulates), and ancestors of whales (cetaceans). There were widespread shifts in plant and animal ranges across continents.\nNotably, many mammal species underwent dwarfing, likely due to higher temperatures and lower nutrient content in plants. Under elevated CO₂ levels, plants can grow faster but tend to have reduced nutritional value, which may explain why early horses shrank in size by 20–30%.\nThe PETM offers a valuable ancient parallel to today’s human-driven global warming, providing important insights into how Earth’s systems and species respond to rapid climate change.</string>
    <string name="paleogene_life_forms">Mammals underwent rapid diversification during the Paleogene period. Some evolved into large land-dwelling forms that would dominate terrestrial ecosystems, while others adapted to life in the oceans, eventually giving rise to modern whales and dolphins (cetaceans). Still others took to the trees and became early primates, the ancestors of monkeys, apes, and humans.\nBirds, already well established by the end of the Cretaceous, also experienced a major adaptive radiation. With the extinction of pterosaurs, they became the dominant flying vertebrates, spreading into a wide variety of ecological niches.\nAs the global climate cooled over the course of the Paleogene, tropical plant species became less widespread, retreating toward equatorial regions. In contrast, temperate forests and grasslands began to expand, shaping the habitats available for the evolving animal life.</string>

    <string name="neogene_physics">Mean temperature: 14 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 21.5%</string>
    <string name="neogene_description">The Neogene is a geological period that spans approximately 20.45 million years, following the Paleogene and preceding the Quaternary. It is subdivided into two epochs: the earlier Miocene and the later Pliocene. During the Pliocene, the formation of the Isthmus of Panama connected North and South America, reshaping ocean currents by cutting off warm Pacific waters from the Atlantic. This event intensified the Gulf Stream, helping transfer more heat toward the Arctic Ocean.\nThroughout the Neogene, Earth\'s global climate cooled significantly, setting the stage for the extensive glaciations of the Quaternary period. Around 20 million years ago, Antarctica was already covered by ice sheets, and northern continents experienced steady cooling. By this time, the world had begun to resemble its modern form, although regions like Florida and parts of Southeast Asia were still submerged under shallow seas.</string>
    <string name="neogene_additional_title">Cooler effect</string>
    <string name="neogene_additional">During the Neogene, the world became significantly drier and cooler, setting the stage for the dramatic climate changes of the Pleistocene ice ages and the challenging conditions of the present day. This period marked the end of the relatively uniform and stable climate that had supported Earth\'s ecosystems for nearly 200 million years, since the Late Triassic.\nAs continental drift continued, the northern continents moved closer together, sealing off the Arctic Ocean. The formation of the Isthmus of Panama blocked warm Pacific currents from entering the Atlantic, altering global ocean circulation. In the south, Antarctica — now isolated from other landmasses — became encircled by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, further cooling the continent.\nFor the first time since the Ordovician, both poles were thermally isolated from equatorial warmth and began accumulating massive ice sheets. These ice sheets reflected more sunlight, lowering global temperatures and sea levels, and further reducing the circulation of warm water.\nAs the climate cooled and dried, vast deserts formed across North Africa and Central Asia. Lush interior forests gave way to arid plains, steppes, prairies, and tundras. Many herbivorous animals either went extinct or adapted to these new environments, along with their predators. By the end of the Neogene, Earth had come to resemble the world we know today.</string>
    <string name="neogene_life_forms">During the Neogene, mammals and birds continued to evolve into forms that closely resemble those of today, while some other groups remained relatively unchanged. Early hominins—the ancestors of modern humans—appeared in Africa near the end of this period and later began migrating into Eurasia.\nTropical plant species gradually declined, giving way to more temperate deciduous vegetation. Grasslands expanded significantly, replacing many former forested regions. As a result, grasses diversified, and many herbivorous mammals evolved specialized teeth and digestive systems to graze on them. This led to the rise of modern grazing animals, such as horses, antelopes, and bovids.</string>

    <string name="quaternary_description">The Quaternary Period is the current and most recent of the three periods within the Cenozoic Era. It is divided into two epochs: the Pleistocene, marked by repeated glacial cycles, and the Holocene, which began approximately 11,700 years ago and continues today. The Quaternary is characterized by cyclic growth and retreat of massive continental ice sheets, driven primarily by variations in Earth\'s orbit and tilt, known as Milankovitch cycles. These cycles significantly influenced global climate patterns, sea levels, and biodiversity. The most recent major glaciation peaked around 21,000 years ago during the Last Glacial Maximum, and the ice sheets began their significant retreat about 12,000 years ago.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_additional_title">Ice Age</string>
    <string name="quaternary_additional">The Quaternary Period is characterized by repeated glaciations driven primarily by the previously mentioned Milankovitch cycles. Earth\'s axial tilt varies between approximately 22.1 and 24.5 degrees over a cycle lasting about 41,000 years. Currently, the tilt is 23.44 degrees, roughly midway between its extremes. A greater tilt increases seasonal contrasts, causing warmer summers and colder winters at higher latitudes, conditions that tend to inhibit glaciation. The Earth\'s tilt last reached its maximum around 10,700 years ago; now, it is decreasing and is expected to reach its minimum in approximately 9,800 years. This decreasing tilt trend promotes milder seasonal variation and a gradual overall cooling, potentially leading to conditions favorable for future ice ages.\nTo appreciate the impact of glaciations, consider three regions at similar latitudes—China, North America, and Europe. China\'s flora remains exceptionally diverse, preserving ancient plant species such as Ginkgo, Magnolia, and Thujopsis, which date back millions of years. Similarly, North America retains ancient species like Taxodium and Sequoiadendron. In contrast, Europe has virtually no ancient plant groups remaining, except a few species in the Mediterranean region. This notable difference is primarily due to geographic factors: during the last Ice Age, extensive ice sheets covered much of Europe. European plants attempting to escape southward faced formidable geographic barriers—the Alps and the Mediterranean Sea—both running predominantly east-west. Consequently, many plant species became extinct in Europe, though some, such as Platanus and Olea, survived in the Mediterranean region. North America, particularly along its eastern coastal regions, remained largely ice-free. Additionally, North American mountain ranges run north-south, providing natural migration corridors for plants fleeing southward ahead of advancing ice. China was largely free of extensive glaciation, allowing its ancient flora to persist with minimal disruption. Remarkably, before the Quaternary glaciations, Europe hosted lush forests filled with ginkgoes and magnolias, a stark contrast to today\'s ecosystems.\nQuaternary glaciations also significantly impacted human migration patterns, repeatedly hindering early human populations from settling permanently in Europe and occasionally wiping out established communities during colder climatic episodes.\nInterestingly, the cycles of glacial advance and retreat significantly shaped modern landscapes worldwide. Iconic features such as fjords, the Great Lakes in North America, and the fertile plains of northern Europe were sculpted directly by these glacial processes. Moreover, the fluctuating sea levels associated with these glacial cycles repeatedly created and destroyed land bridges, influencing the migration and evolution of numerous species, including humans.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_life_forms">The Quaternary is the modern geological period and reflects today\'s familiar fauna and flora. However, repeated glaciations significantly impacted terrestrial life, frequently causing widespread extinction of various plant and animal species. After the last Ice Age ended around 11,700 years ago, many large mammals of the Pleistocene, such as saber-toothed cats, woolly mammoths, mastodons, giant ground sloths, and Irish elk, became extinct worldwide. While climate change played a major role, human activities, including hunting and habitat alteration, also contributed significantly to these extinctions. Today, the legacy of these extinctions can be seen in ecosystems across the globe, influencing current biodiversity patterns and ecological relationships.</string>

    <string name="future_description">Predicting the future is extremely difficult; however, as intelligent life forms, we can try to imagine it. \nEarth will eventually disappear, as the Sun has a finite lifespan and will one day engulf our planet—unless our future descendants find a way to move Earth elsewhere. It is estimated that Earth’s habitable-zone lifespan is around 7.79 billion years. Since we’ve already used up 4.56 billion of those years, we may have about 3.23 billion left—or possibly only 1.75 billion, according to some scientists. The planet will gradually become hotter, and there’s nothing we can do to stop it. The Sun is converting hydrogen into helium, and once a significant amount is used up, it will undergo internal changes and expand into a Red Giant. That’s the reality. \nBut this is the ideal scenario.</string>
    <string name="future_additional_title">Anthropogenic Future</string>
    <string name="future_additional" formatted="false">Life has already demonstrated its persistence and will to exist—it will continue to flourish, with or without humans. Recent trends and growing concern about ecology in society offer a bit of optimism. Just 20 years ago, many people still believed Exxon’s false claims that climate change wasn’t real, and issues like pollution were barely discussed. However, change will happen regardless of our hopes or efforts.\nThere is a hidden risk in our understanding of the economy. A country with an economic growth rate below 3% is often seen as growing too slowly. But what does 3% annual growth really mean? It means the economy doubles roughly every 20 years. Current trends show that economic growth is closely tied to increased energy consumption. Since the Industrial Revolution, our energy usage has skyrocketed, and we still rely heavily on carbon-rich fossil fuels. Renewable energy accounts for only a small fraction of global energy production.\nOne of the fundamental laws of physics states that energy use always generates heat. According to current estimates, in just 400 years we may require as much energy as the Sun produces—and if we continue using energy inefficiently, we could end up boiling our oceans. In 2,000 years, at the current pace, we would need the combined energy of all the stars in the Milky Way galaxy. Now consider the Milky Way’s minimum diameter of 100,000 light-years and ask yourself: can such a rate of consumption be sustained?\nIt is more likely that humanity will discover much more efficient energy sources and adapt to life on Earth, rather than continuing the current path of reshaping Earth to suit human needs.\nRight now, we are experiencing something similar to the Permian-Triassic extinction—only at a much faster pace. We are releasing enormous amounts of carbon dioxide, causing global temperatures to rise and melting polar ice caps that hold vast quantities of trapped methane. Ocean acidity has already increased in recent years, contributing to widespread coral reef die-offs. Anoxic zones are spreading. Forests, which should be absorbing carbon dioxide, are being cut down for economic gain. Sea levels are rising. Areas like Florida and parts of East Asia are already suffering from massive floods.\nCurrent events are steering life on Earth toward the next mass extinction. However, at least now these issues are receiving far more public attention and awareness than ever before.</string>

    <string name="archean_banded_iron_formation_description">Banded iron formations (BIFs) are distinctive sedimentary rock units composed of alternating layers of iron-rich minerals and iron-poor silica-rich bands, typically red due to hematite. These formations provide critical evidence of early biological and geochemical processes.\nThe prevailing hypothesis suggests that BIFs formed in ancient oceans as a result of oxygen released by photosynthetic cyanobacteria. Their presence in the Early Archean suggests that life may have existed as early as 3.85 billion years ago.\nDuring this period, Earth\'s oceans contained vast amounts of dissolved iron. As photosynthetic organisms produced oxygen, the iron reacted with it, precipitating as iron oxides and accumulating in these layered deposits. BIFs are rare in younger geological periods because most of the dissolved iron in the oceans was eventually removed, marking the Great Oxidation Event around 2.4 billion years ago.</string>
    <string name="archean_stromatolites_description">Stromatolites are layered, accretionary structures formed in shallow water through the trapping, binding, and cementation of sedimentary grains by microbial mats, primarily composed of cyanobacteria.\nFossilized stromatolites provide some of the oldest direct evidence of life on Earth, with examples dating back over 3.45 billion years. They exhibit a variety of forms and structures, ranging from columnar to domal shapes. While stromatolites are typically associated with biological activity, some possess features consistent with abiotic precipitation, making their origin a subject of ongoing study.\nStromatolites reached their peak diversity around 1.25 billion years ago, after which they declined in abundance and morphological variety, likely due to the rise of grazing organisms. Today, modern stromatolites are rare and primarily found in extreme environments such as hypersaline lakes and marine lagoons, where high salinity deters most grazing animals.</string>
    <string name="archean_primaevifilum_amoenum_description">Primaevifilum amoenum is one of the oldest known bacteria, with fossilized remains discovered in Western Australia. It was a filamentous microorganism that primarily lived in individual clasts, though it may have been part of a loosely organized benthic microbial community embedded in mucilage.\nUnlike many early microbial fossils, its microfossils have not been detected in stromatolite-like laminated clasts, suggesting a different ecological niche. These findings contribute to our understanding of early microbial diversity and the environmental conditions of the Archean Earth.</string>
    <string name="archean_acritarcha_description">Acritarchs are small, organic-walled microfossils that are resistant to acid dissolution and remain taxonomically unclassified. They represent a diverse group of structures, including the resting cysts of various green algae and possibly other microorganisms. Some acritarchs may also be linked to the reproductive or protective stages of unknown ancient eukaryotic life forms. Their sudden diversification during the late Precambrian is often interpreted as evidence of rising oxygen levels and the expansion of marine ecosystems. Due to their resilience and abundance in the fossil record, acritarchs serve as valuable biostratigraphic markers, helping scientists understand the evolution of early life and past environmental conditions.</string>

    <string name="proterozoic_bangiomorpha_pubescens_description">Bangiomorpha pubescens is the earliest known sexually reproducing organism, dating to approximately 1.2 billion years ago. It belongs to the red algae (Rhodophyta) and is considered one of the first complex multicellular eukaryotes. Discovered in the Hunting Formation of Arctic Canada, this microscopic red alga is remarkably similar to modern Bangiophyceae-a group that includes today’s Bangia and Porphyra (nori seaweed). Bangiomorpha formed simple, filamentous colonies anchored to surfaces in shallow marine environments. Its cellular organization, division patterns, and reproductive structures closely resemble those of living red algae, indicating a high level of biological complexity more than a billion years ago. The emergence of sexual reproduction was a pivotal moment in evolutionary history, not only because of the benefits of genetic recombination but also because it enabled the development of complex multicellularity. This evolutionary breakthrough laid the foundation for the diversification of eukaryotic life, making Bangiomorpha a crucial organism in the history of life on Earth.</string>
    <string name="proterozoic_nemiana_simplex_description">Nemiana simplex was a soft-bodied organism that lived on the seafloor during the Ediacaran Period, before the appearance of complex animal life in the Cambrian. It is known from circular, low-relief fossil impressions preserved in ancient marine sediments. These simple, disc-shaped forms-often only a few centimeters across-are thought to represent either soft-bodied organisms resting on the seafloor or microbial colonies embedded in sediment. The structure of Nemiana lacks clear evidence of organs, symmetry, or appendages, making its biological classification uncertain. Some paleontologists interpret it as a type of benthic (bottom-dwelling) colonial organism, while others consider it a microbial structure rather than a true animal. It was found in Ediacaran fossil sites across Russia, Ukraine, and other parts of Eastern Europe.</string>
    <string name="proterozoic_tribrachidium_heraldicum_description">Tribrachidium heraldicum was one of the most distinctive and enigmatic organisms of the Ediacaran seas. It had a rounded, dome-shaped body about 3-5 centimeters in diameter and displayed a unique threefold (triradial) symmetry-a body plan unlike any modern animal. The upper surface bore three spiral arms radiating from the center, forming grooves that may have directed water currents across its body. Recent studies using 3D modeling suggest Tribrachidium was a suspension feeder, capturing tiny organic particles as water flowed over its surface while it remained attached to the seafloor. Its exact biological relationships are uncertain, but it is generally considered part of the extinct Ediacaran biota-an early experiment in multicellular life that predates the rise of recognizable animal groups. Fossils of Tribrachidium have been found in South Australia, Russia, and Ukraine, providing valuable insight into the diversity and ecological innovation of pre-Cambrian life.</string>
    <string name="proterozoic_dickinsonia_description">Dickinsonia was one of the most iconic members of the Ediacaran biota and among the earliest known complex multicellular organisms. It had an oval, ribbed body that could grow up to 1.4 meters in length, with a series of repeated, quilt-like segments radiating from a central axis. Dickinsonia lived on the seafloor, moving slowly across microbial mats and absorbing nutrients directly through its soft body surface-a feeding method known as osmotrophy. Its body lacked hard parts, a mouth, or an anus, and it likely had a simple, jelly-like internal structure. For decades, scientists debated whether Dickinsonia was an animal, fungus, or giant protist, but recent chemical analyses of fossilized molecules (biomarkers) revealed cholesterol, strongly supporting its classification as one of the earliest animals. Fossils have been found in Australia, Russia, and Ukraine.</string>
    <string name="proterozoic_cloudina_description">Cloudina was one of the earliest animals to build a hard, mineralized skeleton, marking a major evolutionary milestone at the dawn of the Cambrian explosion. It was a small, tube-shaped organism-typically only a few millimeters long-composed of stacked, cone-like calcium carbonate segments. These tubes likely housed soft-bodied, worm-like creatures that anchored themselves to the seafloor or clustered on reef-like structures. Fossil evidence shows that Cloudina lived in shallow marine environments and may have formed colonies, contributing to some of the earliest reef ecosystems. Remarkably, some Cloudina fossils show small holes interpreted as signs of predation, making them the oldest known evidence of animals preying upon other animals. This suggests that Cloudina lived during a time of increasing ecological complexity and biological arms races that set the stage for the Cambrian explosion. Fossils have been found in Namibia, Oman, China, and other regions worldwide.</string>
    <string name="proterozoic_charnia_description">Charnia was one of the earliest known complex multicellular organisms and a classic representative of the Ediacaran biota. It had a frond-like body that could reach over 60 centimeters in length, composed of repeated leaf-like branches arranged along a central stem. Charnia was anchored to the seafloor by a holdfast and likely lived in deep marine environments below the reach of sunlight. Because of this, it did not rely on photosynthesis; instead, it probably absorbed dissolved organic matter directly from the surrounding water, a lifestyle known as osmotrophy. Its body structure shows no sign of a mouth, gut, or any modern animal features, placing it among an extinct group of enigmatic organisms that flourished before the Cambrian explosion. Fossils of Charnia were first discovered in Charnwood Forest, England, and represent some of the oldest known macroscopic life forms on Earth.</string>
    <string name="proterozoic_grypania_spiralis_description">Grypania is one of the oldest known macroscopic, multicellular organisms in the fossil record. Appearing as ribbon-like, coiled impressions up to several centimeters long, Grypania likely represented a eukaryotic alga, possibly an early form of photosynthetic life. Its simple, unsegmented shape suggests it lacked complex tissues, yet it was far larger than typical microscopic life of the time, indicating a significant evolutionary leap toward large, visible organisms. Fossils of Grypania have been found in North America, China, and India, showing that it persisted for over a billion years - a remarkable survival span in Earth’s history. It inhabited shallow marine environments, where it likely floated or attached to the sea floor, contributing to primary production in ancient ecosystems. Grypania’s existence marks a critical step in the transition from microbial worlds to the diverse multicellular life that would later flourish in the Cambrian Explosion.</string>
    <string name="proterozoic_spriggina_description">Spriggina was a small, bilaterally symmetrical organism from the Ediacaran biota, growing to about 3-5 centimeters (1-2 inches) in length. Its body was elongated and segmented, with a distinct head-like front end, making it one of the earliest known animals to show clear signs of a front and rear. The segments were arranged in a slightly offset, “glide reflection” pattern, a feature that has sparked debate over its evolutionary relationships - some researchers suggest it was an early arthropod or annelid relative, while others view it as part of an extinct lineage unique to the Ediacaran Period. Spriggina likely moved slowly across the sea floor, possibly grazing on microbial mats that covered the sediment. Fossils are best known from the Ediacara Hills of South Australia, where they preserve fine surface details of the creature’s body. Spriggina’s combination of symmetry, segmentation, and a differentiated body axis marks it as a key transitional form leading toward the complex animals of the Cambrian Explosion.</string>
    <string name="proterozoic_kimberella_description">Kimberella was a soft-bodied, oval-shaped organism that is widely regarded as one of the earliest animals showing evidence of bilaterality-a body plan with distinct left and right sides. Measuring up to 15 centimeters (6 inches) in length, it had a low, dome-like body covered by a flexible, non-mineralized “shell” or outer covering. The front of Kimberella’s body was broader and more rounded, while the rear tapered slightly, suggesting a clear direction of movement. Fossil evidence, including scratch marks preserved in the sediment, indicates it used a proboscis-like feeding organ to scrape microbial mats from the sea floor, much like modern mollusks use a radula. This has led many paleontologists to propose that Kimberella was an early stem-group mollusk, making it one of the oldest known members of the lineage leading to snails, clams, and squids. Fossils are best known from the Ediacara Hills of South Australia and the White Sea region of Russia. Kimberella’s anatomy and feeding traces offer a rare glimpse into the evolutionary steps that bridged simple Ediacaran life and the more complex, mobile animals of the Cambrian.</string>
    <string name="proterozoic_rangea_description">Rangea was a frond-like organism and one of the most iconic members of the Ediacaran biota. It consisted of six radially arranged, leaf-like fronds connected at a central base, giving it a symmetrical, star-shaped appearance when viewed from above. Each frond displayed intricate quilt-like branching patterns, thought to have maximized surface area for nutrient absorption. Rangea lacked a mouth, gut, or any internal organs, and instead likely absorbed dissolved nutrients directly from seawater-a feeding strategy common among many Ediacaran organisms. Anchored to the sea floor in shallow marine environments, it may have stood partially upright in the water column, swaying gently with currents. Fossils of Rangea have been found in Namibia, where fine-grained sediments preserved their delicate three-dimensional structure in remarkable detail. Its body plan is so unlike any modern animal that its evolutionary relationships remain uncertain, though it is often placed within the extinct group Rangeomorpha, a unique branch of multicellular life that vanished before the Cambrian Explosion. Rangea exemplifies the strange and experimental nature of life in the late Proterozoic oceans.</string>

    <string name="cambrian_treptichnus_pedum_description">Treptichnus pedum is not a body fossil but an ichnofossil - a preserved trace of an organism’s behavior, marking one of the most important boundaries in Earth’s history: the formal beginning of the Cambrian Period. It consists of a complex, branching network of burrows that show evidence of active movement and systematic probing of the sediment by a worm-like animal. The structure of the burrows indicates an organism with a head and specialized feeding appendages capable of exploring and disturbing the seafloor in search of food. This represents a major step in animal evolution, signaling the emergence of bilaterally symmetrical animals with directed movement and complex behaviors. Treptichnus pedum is so significant that its first appearance defines the base of the Phanerozoic Eon and the Cambrian System in the geological timescale. Fossils are found in Namibia, Newfoundland, and other regions, providing a global marker for the dawn of complex animal life.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_conodonta_description">Conodonta were tiny, eel-like marine animals best known for their microscopic, tooth-shaped fossils, which are among the most important tools in stratigraphy. These fossils are called conodont elements and were made of apatite (the same material as vertebrate teeth) and formed complex feeding apparatuses within the animals’ mouths. Although soft-bodied and rarely preserved, exceptional fossils reveal that conodonts were early, primitive chordates, related to the ancestors of vertebrates. Measuring only a few centimeters long, they likely swam freely in the oceans, preying on small plankton. Conodont elements evolved rapidly and are found in abundance in marine sediments, making them excellent index fossils for dating Paleozoic and early Mesozoic rocks. The extinction of conodonts in the Late Triassic marked the end of one of the most enduring and successful microfossil lineages in Earth’s history.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_archaeocyatha_description">Archaeocyatha were an extinct group of sponge-like, reef-building marine animals that flourished during the Early Cambrian. Their calcareous skeletons formed cup or cone shaped structures, often with multiple porous walls separated by radial partitions, allowing water to flow through for filter feeding. Most individuals were only a few centimeters tall, but they often lived in dense colonies that created the first large reef ecosystems in Earth’s history. These reefs provided shelter for a variety of early marine organisms and played a key role in shaping the rapidly diversifying Cambrian seas. Archaeocyaths are generally regarded as an early branch of the sponges (Porifera), though their exact relationships remain debated. They disappeared by the Middle Cambrian, likely due to environmental changes and competition from other reef-building organisms such as stromatoporoids and corals. Fossils of Archaeocyatha are abundant in Australia, Siberia, and North America, serving as important index fossils for dating Early Cambrian rocks.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_trilobita_description">Trilobita (trilobites) were one of the most diverse and successful groups of early arthropods, thriving in Earth’s oceans for over 270 million years. They are easily recognized by their three-lobed, segmented exoskeleton, which was divided lengthwise into a central axis and two side lobes, and crosswise into head (cephalon), thorax, and tail (pygidium). Ranging in size from a few millimeters to over 70 centimeters, trilobites occupied nearly every marine habitat - from shallow coastal waters to deep-sea environments. Some were active predators or scavengers, while others filtered particles from the water or burrowed into the seafloor sediment. They also represent the earliest known arthropods with complex compound eyes, a key evolutionary advancement in vision. Trilobites underwent numerous radiations and extinctions throughout the Paleozoic, ultimately disappearing at the end-Permian mass extinction. Their abundance, rapid evolution, and global distribution make them invaluable index fossils for dating Paleozoic rock layers.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_wiwaxia_description">Wiwaxia was a small, soft-bodied marine animal that lived on the Cambrian seafloor and is known for its bizarre armor of overlapping scales (sclerites) and long, sharp spines. It measured up to 5 centimeters in length and likely crawled slowly over the substrate, using a radula-like feeding organ to scrape algae or organic material from the sea floor - similar to modern mollusks. Its body was covered with rows of leaf-shaped plates for protection, while pairs of long dorsal spines may have deterred predators. Wiwaxia occupies an uncertain position in the tree of life: many scientists interpret it as an early relative of mollusks or annelid worms, while others see it as a separate branch of early lophotrochozoans. Fossils are best known from the Burgess Shale of Canada, where their exquisite preservation provides a vivid glimpse into Cambrian marine ecosystems. Wiwaxia highlights the experimental body forms that characterized the Cambrian explosion, when major animal groups first appeared and diversified.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_myllokunmingia_description">Myllokunmingia is one of the earliest known vertebrates, providing crucial evidence for the origin of the backbone and the early evolution of fishes. Measuring about 2.5 centimeters in length, this small, soft-bodied animal had a streamlined, fish-like form with a distinct head, trunk, and tail. Fossils from the Chengjiang Biota in Yunnan, China, reveal internal structures such as a notochord (a primitive backbone), myomeres (segmented muscles), gill pouches, and possibly a dorsal fin - hallmarks of early vertebrate anatomy. Unlike later jawless fishes, Myllokunmingia lacked bones and a well-developed skull, but it already exhibited the key body plan that would give rise to all vertebrates, including humans. As one of the oldest members of the vertebrate lineage, Myllokunmingia marks a foundational step in the evolution of complex animals with internal skeletons.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_pikaia_description">Pikaia is one of the earliest known chordates and a key ancestor-like organism in the evolutionary lineage leading to vertebrates. Measuring about 4 centimeters in length, it had a slender, lanceolate body with a notochord - a flexible rod that served as a primitive backbone, along with segmented muscles (myomeres) and a dorsal nerve cord. These features are hallmarks of the chordate body plan shared by all vertebrates today. Pikaia likely swam by undulating its body in gentle, eel-like motions and may have fed by filtering particles or detritus from the water. Its fossils were discovered in the Burgess Shale of British Columbia, Canada, one of the most famous fossil sites preserving soft-bodied Cambrian animals. Though simple in appearance, Pikaia represents a crucial evolutionary link between invertebrate ancestors and the earliest vertebrates, showing the first clear blueprint of the body structure that would eventually give rise to fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_anomalocaris_description">Anomalocaris was one of the largest and most formidable predators of the Cambrian seas, reaching lengths of up to 1 meter - enormous for its time. Its name means “unusual shrimp,” originally given before scientists realized that its various fossilized parts (mouth, limbs, and body segments) belonged to a single animal. Anomalocaris had a segmented, flexible body with large flaps along its sides for swimming and a pair of spiny, grasping appendages at the front for capturing prey. Its circular mouth, lined with hard, toothed plates, could crush the shells of trilobites and other armored creatures. Two large, stalked compound eyes gave it excellent vision, making it an efficient, fast-moving hunter. Fossils from the Burgess Shale in Canada, as well as sites in China and Australia, show that Anomalocaris was an early member of the arthropod lineage and one of the first true apex predators in Earth’s oceans. Its appearance marks a major step in the development of complex food webs during the Cambrian explosion.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_opabinia_description">Opabinia was one of the most unusual animals of the Cambrian seas, known for its bizarre anatomy and alien-like appearance. It measured about 7 centimeters long and had a soft, segmented body with lobed flaps for swimming and a fan-shaped tail for steering. Its most distinctive feature was a long, flexible proboscis ending in a claw-like structure, which it likely used to grab food and bring it to its backward-facing mouth. Opabinia also possessed five stalked eyes on top of its head, giving it an excellent field of vision to detect prey or predators on the seafloor. It is thought to have been a soft-bodied scavenger or predator that lived in shallow marine environments. Fossils from the Burgess Shale in Canada reveal remarkable preservation of its delicate tissues, allowing paleontologists to recognize it as a distant relative of arthropods. Opabinia exemplifies the experimental body plans of the Cambrian explosion, when evolution explored a vast diversity of anatomical designs unlike anything seen today.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_marrella_description">Marrella was a small arthropod from the Burgess Shale of Canada and one of the most common and best-preserved fossils from that iconic site. Measuring only about 2 centimeters long, Marrella had a delicate, segmented body with numerous legs and a pair of long, curved spines projecting backward from its head. It also possessed ornate head shields and feathery appendages that likely helped in swimming or filtering food particles from the water. Although once thought to be a type of crustacean or trilobite, detailed studies show that Marrella belongs to an extinct branch of early arthropods, not directly related to any modern group. It probably lived as a benthic scavenger or detritivore, crawling along the seafloor and feeding on organic debris. Marrella exemplifies the extraordinary diversity of arthropod body forms that evolved during the Cambrian explosion, and it was the very first Burgess Shale fossil ever discovered and described by Charles Doolittle Walcott in 1909.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_foraminifera_description">Foraminifera (commonly called forams) are single-celled protists that build intricate shells, or tests, usually made of calcium carbonate or organic material. Despite their microscopic size, most are less than 1 millimeter across, they are among the most ecologically and geologically important organisms in Earth’s history. Living both as plankton in the open ocean and as benthic species on the seafloor, foraminifera capture food particles with fine extensions of their cell membrane called pseudopodia. Their incredible diversity, rapid evolutionary rates, and sensitivity to environmental changes make them powerful tools for biostratigraphy and paleoenvironmental reconstruction. The chemical composition of their shells provides crucial data about ancient ocean temperatures, salinity, and even global climate shifts. Foraminiferal fossils are found in vast numbers in marine sediments worldwide, forming chalk, limestone, and other carbonate rocks. Their evolutionary history spans over half a billion years, continuing to the present day, making foraminifera one of the most successful and enduring lineages in Earth’s biosphere.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_hallucigenia_description">Hallucigenia is one of the most bizarre and iconic creatures of the Cambrian explosion, known from the Burgess Shale of Canada and similar deposits in China. Measuring only about 1-5 centimeters long, it had a tubular, worm-like body with pairs of long spines on its back for protection and multiple pairs of soft, claw-tipped legs along its underside for crawling. Its head bore a simple mouth surrounded by tiny teeth and flexible sensory appendages. For decades, paleontologists were unsure which way Hallucigenia should be oriented as early reconstructions even showed it walking on its spines, until improved fossils revealed its true form. It is now recognized as a close relative of modern velvet worms (Onychophora), sharing features such as soft limbs and claw structures. Hallucigenia exemplifies the experimental body plans of the Cambrian seas and helps illuminate the origins of arthropods and other molting animals.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_nectocaris_description">Nectocaris was a small, soft-bodied marine animal whose exact classification puzzled paleontologists for decades. Growing to about 5-10 centimeters (2-4 inches) in length, it had a flattened, kite-shaped body with two long, flexible tentacle-like appendages at the front, a pair of lateral fins for swimming, and a broad tail fan for steering. Its large, stalked eyes suggest it was an active visual hunter, likely preying on small arthropods and other soft-bodied creatures in Cambrian seas. Fossils from the Burgess Shale in Canada have revealed fine details of its anatomy, leading researchers to propose that Nectocaris may be an early relative of cephalopods, making it potentially the oldest known member of this group, hundreds of millions of years older than previously thought. Its streamlined body and predatory lifestyle hint at the early evolutionary experiments that would later produce squids, cuttlefish, and octopuses.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_omnidens_description">Omnidens was an enigmatic marine animal known only from its distinctive mouthparts, found in fossil beds in what is now China. Its name, meaning “all teeth,” refers to the circular arrangement of tough, tooth-like plates that formed its feeding structure. Based on these remains, paleontologists believe Omnidens may have been related to anomalocaridids - large, soft-bodied predators of the Cambrian seas, but it was even larger than most, with estimates suggesting a total body length of over 1 meter (3.3 feet). Its formidable mouth would have been well-suited for grasping and crushing prey such as trilobites and other hard-shelled animals. Though much of its anatomy remains a mystery, Omnidens highlights the diversity and evolutionary experimentation that characterized the Cambrian Explosion, when early animal life rapidly branched into a variety of forms.</string>

    <string name="ordovician_orthoceras_description">Orthoceras was an extinct genus of straight-shelled cephalopods that lived in the Paleozoic oceans and is among the earliest and most widespread relatives of modern squids, octopuses, and nautiluses. Its long, conical shell, often reaching lengths of up to 2 meters, was divided internally into chambers connected by a central tube called a siphuncle, which the animal used to regulate buoyancy and move up or down in the water column. The soft body occupied the outermost chamber, and Orthoceras propelled itself by jetting water through a siphon, much like modern cephalopods. It was an active predator, feeding on small arthropods and other marine invertebrates. Orthoceras fossils are found in marine limestone deposits across the world, from Morocco to the Baltic region, and their polished shells are commonly used in decorative stonework. As one of the dominant cephalopods of the early Paleozoic, Orthoceras represents an important stage in the evolution of complex marine predators.</string>
    <string name="ordovician_pentecopterus_description">Pentecopterus decorahensis was a giant eurypterid, or “sea scorpion,” and one of the earliest known large arthropod predators. Reaching lengths of up to 1.7 meters, it prowled the warm, shallow seas that covered parts of what is now Iowa, USA. Its name, inspired by the ancient Greek warship penteconter, reflects its powerful, streamlined body adapted for swimming and ambush hunting. Pentecopterus had a broad, spiny head shield, large grasping limbs for seizing prey, and paddle-like appendages for propulsion through the water. As a top predator, it fed on trilobites, early fish, and other marine invertebrates, playing a crucial role in Ordovician ecosystems. Exceptionally well preserved fossils from the Decorah shale reveal fine details of its exoskeleton, making it one of the best documented early eurypterids. Pentecopterus demonstrates that arthropods achieved large body sizes and ecological dominance in marine environments long before vertebrate predators evolved to similar scales.</string>
    <string name="ordovician_sacabambaspis_description">Sacabambaspis was one of the earliest known vertebrates with a bony head shield and a representative of the pteraspidomorphs, an early group of jawless fishes. It measured about 25-40 centimeters long and had a flattened, tadpole-like body with no jaws or paired fins. Its head was covered by large, bony plates that formed a protective shield, while the rest of the body was flexible and covered with small scales. Sacabambaspis likely swam close to the seafloor, using its tail for propulsion and feeding by sucking in small organic particles or microorganisms. Its fossils, found in Bolivia and Australia, show that early armored fishes already had a global distribution in Ordovician seas. Sacabambaspis provides a key glimpse into the early evolution of vertebrate armor and body structure, laying the foundation for later groups of jawless fishes and, eventually, jawed vertebrates.</string>
    <string name="ordovician_astraspis_description">Astraspis was one of the earliest known armored jawless fishes, representing a primitive stage in vertebrate evolution. Measuring about 20-30 centimeters long, it had an oval, spindle-shaped body covered with bony plates and small mineralized scales that provided protection against predators. Its head was enclosed in a solid armor of bone-like material (astragal scales), pierced by openings for the eyes and gills. Astraspis lacked jaws and paired fins but possessed a muscular tail for propulsion, suggesting it was an active swimmer that likely fed by filtering small particles from the water or by suction feeding on soft sediments. Fossils have been found primarily in North America, notably in Colorado and Wyoming, preserved in marine rocks that once formed part of the ancient Ordovician seafloor. As one of the earliest vertebrates with mineralized armor, Astraspis marks a major step toward the development of the protective exoskeletons and internal structures seen in later fishes.</string>
    <string name="ordovician_rugosa_description">Rugosa, commonly known as horn corals, were an extinct order of marine corals that built both solitary and colonial forms. Their name comes from the distinctive wrinkled, or “rugose,” texture of their calcium carbonate skeletons. Solitary rugose corals often formed horn-shaped cones that could reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, while colonial varieties created complex coral reefs. Inside the skeleton, Rugosa displayed a characteristic pattern of radiating partitions called septa, which divided the internal cavity into symmetrical chambers, a structure that makes them easily recognizable in fossils. These corals lived attached to the seafloor in warm, shallow seas, extending tentacles to capture plankton and other small organisms. Rugose corals flourished throughout the Paleozoic Era, forming major reef systems alongside tabulate corals, before going extinct during the end-Permian mass extinction. Their fossils are common in limestone formations and are important index fossils for dating Paleozoic marine rocks.</string>
    <string name="ordovician_tabulata_description">Tabulata, commonly known as tabulate corals, were an extinct order of colonial corals that formed some of the most extensive reef systems of the Paleozoic Era. Unlike solitary Rugosa corals, tabulates lived exclusively in colonies composed of hundreds to thousands of small, closely packed tubes called corallites, each housing a tiny coral polyp. These corallites were divided horizontally by internal partitions known as tabulae - a feature that gives the group its name. Most tabulates lacked the vertical septa seen in other coral groups, giving their internal structure a honeycomb-like appearance, as seen in genera such as Favosites and Halysites (“chain coral”). They inhabited warm, shallow seas and built large reef frameworks in partnership with sponges and algae. Though they were highly successful throughout the Ordovician, Silurian, and Devonian periods, tabulate corals declined in the Late Paleozoic and went extinct during the end-Permian mass extinction. Their fossils are abundant and serve as important index fossils for Paleozoic marine environments.</string>
    <string name="ordovician_aegirocassis_description">Aegirocassis was a giant arthropod that swam in the ancient seas during a time when life was rapidly diversifying. Belonging to the anomalocaridids - a group better known from the Cambrian. Aegirocassis reached lengths of up to 2 meters (6.5 feet), making it one of the largest animals of its era. Unlike its predatory Cambrian relatives, this creature was a gentle filter feeder. It used long, comb-like spines on its head appendages to strain plankton from the water, much like modern baleen whales. Its body was equipped with pairs of flaps for propulsion and stabilization, allowing it to glide gracefully through the water. The discovery of Aegirocassis in Morocco revealed that some anomalocaridids had shifted from hunting to plankton-feeding, showing an early example of large filter-feeding in Earth’s oceans. Its name combines “Aegir,” the Norse sea god, with “cassis,” Latin for helmet, reflecting its oceanic nature and armored head.</string>
    <string name="ordovician_cameroceras_description">Cameroceras was one of the largest known orthoconic (straight-shelled) cephalopods, and a top predator of the Paleozoic seas. Its shell could reach lengths of 6-9 meters (20-30 feet), making it one of the biggest animals of its time. The long, tapered shell housed its soft body at the wider end, with tentacles extending forward to seize prey. Cameroceras had a beak-like mouth capable of crushing the hard shells of trilobites and other armored marine creatures, as well as softer-bodied prey. It propelled itself using jet propulsion, much like modern squids, by expelling water through a siphon. Fossils have been found in North America and parts of Europe, indicating it thrived in warm, shallow epicontinental seas. As an apex predator, Cameroceras played a key role in shaping Late Ordovician marine ecosystems, long before vertebrate predators rose to dominance.</string>

    <string name="silurian_eurypterus_description">Eurypterus was a genus of eurypterids, commonly known as “sea scorpions,” and one of the most successful aquatic arthropods of the Paleozoic Era. Typically reaching about 1 meter in length, though some individuals grew larger, Eurypterus had a segmented body with a broad head shield, large compound eyes, and a long, tapering tail ending in a spine. Its front limbs were equipped with spines for seizing prey, while its hind limbs evolved into broad, paddle-like appendages for swimming, making it an agile predator or scavenger in shallow coastal waters and estuaries. It likely fed on small fish, trilobites, and other invertebrates. Fossils of Eurypterus are especially common in Silurian deposits of New York State (USA) and Estonia, where entire exoskeletons have been exquisitely preserved. As one of the last great eurypterids before the group’s extinction, Eurypterus represents the culmination of sea scorpion evolution, showcasing the transition of arthropods toward increasingly complex and active lifestyles in ancient aquatic ecosystems.</string>
    <string name="silurian_pneumodesmus_description">Pneumodesmus newmani is the oldest known land-dwelling animal in the fossil record, representing a milestone in the colonization of terrestrial environments. This tiny millipede-like arthropod, only about 1 centimeter long, lived in what is now Scotland when life on land was still in its infancy. Its segmented body, multiple pairs of legs, and hardened exoskeleton indicate it was well adapted to crawling on solid ground, possibly among early mosses and microbial mats. Most importantly, its fossil shows small openings along the body spiracles, used for breathing air, providing the earliest evidence of a true terrestrial respiratory system in an animal. Pneumodesmus likely fed on decaying plant or microbial matter, contributing to the early development of soil ecosystems. Its discovery marks a crucial evolutionary step, showing how arthropods began to move from aquatic habitats onto land, paving the way for future terrestrial animals.</string>
    <string name="silurian_cooksonia_description">Cooksonia is one of the earliest known vascular plants, representing a major evolutionary breakthrough in the colonization of land by complex life. Typically only a few centimeters tall, Cooksonia had slender, branching stems that ended in small, round sporangia - spore-producing capsules used for reproduction. It lacked true leaves and roots but possessed vascular tissue, allowing it to transport water and nutrients internally and stand upright above the ground. This adaptation marked a key step in the evolution of modern plants. Cooksonia likely grew in moist, low-lying environments near rivers or wetlands, forming small colonies that helped stabilize early soils and contributed to the buildup of oxygen in the atmosphere. Fossils have been found across Europe, North America, and South America, showing that it was widespread during the Silurian and Devonian periods. As one of the first plants capable of living fully on land, Cooksonia symbolizes the greening of the continents and the beginning of terrestrial ecosystems.</string>
    <string name="silurian_baragwanathia_description">Baragwanathia was one of the earliest known lycophyte plants, a group that still survives today as club mosses. Growing up to 50 centimeters tall, it had slender, branching stems covered with narrow, pointed leaves containing vascular tissue - an important adaptation that allowed efficient water and nutrient transport, enabling it to live fully on land. Spore-bearing structures (sporangia) were attached to the upper parts of the stems, releasing spores for reproduction. Baragwanathia fossils have been found in Australia, Canada, and China, indicating it was widespread during the transition from aquatic to terrestrial ecosystems. It likely grew along riverbanks and moist floodplains, contributing to early soil stabilization and the gradual expansion of plant life across the continents. As one of the first plants with true leaves and an organized vascular system, Baragwanathia represents a crucial step in the evolution of complex land flora that paved the way for later forests.</string>
    <string name="silurian_acanthodii_description">Acanthodians, often called “spiny sharks,” were an extinct class of early jawed fishes that combined features of both bony fish (Osteichthyes) and cartilaginous fish (Chondrichthyes). Despite their nickname, they were not true sharks but rather their distant relatives. Most species were small, ranging from a few centimeters to half a meter in length, and had streamlined bodies covered with tiny, rhomboid scales. Their defining characteristic was the presence of numerous sharp spines supporting their fins, which likely offered stability and protection from predators. Acanthodians were among the first vertebrates to develop jaws and paired fins, marking a key evolutionary leap in vertebrate anatomy. They lived in both marine and freshwater environments, feeding on plankton or small invertebrates. Although they disappeared by the end of the Permian, acanthodians played a vital role in vertebrate evolution, standing near the base of the lineage that gave rise to all modern fishes and, ultimately, terrestrial vertebrates.</string>
    <string name="silurian_entelognathus_description">Entelognathus was a remarkable prehistoric fish from China that revolutionized our understanding of vertebrate evolution. Belonging to the placoderms - an extinct group of armored fishes - it possessed a combination of primitive and modern features that bridged the gap between early jawless fishes and later bony fishes. About 20 centimeters long, Entelognathus had a heavily armored head and shoulders but, unlike other placoderms, its jaws were made of bone plates identical in pattern to those of modern bony fishes (Osteichthyes). This discovery revealed that the complex bony jaw structure of modern fishes and tetrapods evolved earlier than previously thought, originating in placoderms rather than appearing independently later. Entelognathus lived in shallow marine environments, likely feeding on small invertebrates along the seafloor. Its fossils, found in Yunnan, China, are exquisitely preserved and provide one of the clearest examples of a transitional form in vertebrate evolution, showing how the modern vertebrate face first took shape.</string>
    <string name="silurian_pterygotus_description">Pterygotus was one of the largest and most formidable eurypterids, or “sea scorpions,” that ever lived. Some species reached lengths of 2.3-2.5 meters, making it one of the top arthropod predators of the Paleozoic. Its long, streamlined body and powerful, paddle-like swimming appendages suggest it was an agile and fast swimmer, capable of pursuing prey in the coastal and estuarine waters of ancient Euramerica and beyond.\nThe head of Pterygotus bore large compound eyes and a pair of robust, spiny chelicerae (grasping claws) used for seizing fish, trilobites, and other marine animals. These claws could be quite large and were among its most effective hunting tools. Its overall body plan indicates an active, visually oriented predator, more like a marine hunter than a bottom-dwelling ambush scorpion.\nFossils have been found in Scotland, Norway, the United States, and Australia, showcasing its wide distribution.</string>

    <string name="devonian_prototaxites_description">Prototaxites was one of the largest and most mysterious organisms of the Paleozoic Era, towering up to 8 meters tall and 1 meter wide-an enormous size for life on land at the time. For over a century, scientists debated its identity, variously interpreting it as a giant alga, a lichen, or even an early tree. Today, most evidence suggests Prototaxites was a fungus or fungus-like organism that formed massive, trunk-like structures composed of tangled filaments (hyphae). It likely lived on land in association with early plants and microbial mats, absorbing nutrients from decaying organic matter. Fossils have been found in North America, Europe, and the Middle East, revealing that Prototaxites dominated terrestrial landscapes before the rise of true forests. Its immense size and uncertain biology make it a symbol of the experimental nature of early terrestrial ecosystems, when fungi, algae, and primitive plants were first spreading across land.</string>
    <string name="devonian_wattieza_description">Wattieza was one of the earliest known trees, marking a pivotal moment in the greening of the Earth. Growing up to 8-10 meters tall, it resembled a modern tree fern, with a slender trunk and a crown of branching fronds instead of leaves. Unlike earlier land plants, Wattieza had true woody tissue (xylem) that allowed it to grow tall and support its weight, as well as to transport water efficiently from the roots to the upper branches. It reproduced using spores rather than seeds and thrived in swampy or forested environments, forming the first true forests in Earth’s history. Fossils of Wattieza were first discovered in New York State, where its trunk was once mistaken for the remains of an ancient palm. The discovery of its crown and branches later confirmed its identity as a towering spore-bearing plant. Wattieza represents a major step in terrestrial evolution-the rise of tall vegetation that transformed the atmosphere, stabilized soils, and laid the foundation for complex land ecosystems.</string>
    <string name="devonian_archaeopteris_description">Archaeopteris was one of the first true trees and a cornerstone in the evolution of modern forests. It could grow up to 20 meters tall and combined features of both ferns and seed plants. Its woody trunk and extensive root system gave it great structural strength, while its fern-like fronds performed photosynthesis and shed seasonally like leaves. Archaeopteris reproduced by spores rather than seeds but possessed secondary growth (wood formation)-a crucial innovation that allowed it to grow taller and live longer than earlier plants. This combination of traits made it an evolutionary bridge between primitive vascular plants and the first seed-bearing trees (gymnosperms). Archaeopteris formed vast forests across what are now North America, Europe, and Africa, profoundly altering the planet’s atmosphere by increasing oxygen levels and stabilizing soils. It represents a turning point in Earth’s history-the time when plants began to shape global ecosystems on a scale comparable to modern forests.</string>
    <string name="devonian_tiktaalik_description">Tiktaalik is one of the most famous transitional fossils, bridging the evolutionary gap between fish and the first amphibians to walk on land. Measuring up to 2.7 meters long, it had a flattened, crocodile-like body adapted for life in shallow freshwater habitats. Tiktaalik possessed both fish-like features-such as fins with fin rays, scales, and gills-and tetrapod-like traits, including a mobile neck, robust ribs, and limb bones capable of supporting its body in shallow water or on muddy surfaces. Its pectoral fins contained bones equivalent to the upper arm, forearm, and wrist of later land vertebrates, showing how limbs evolved from fins. Fossils discovered in Arctic Canada reveal a creature that could both swim efficiently and push itself up in shallow environments, an ideal lifestyle for an organism transitioning from water to land. Tiktaalik represents a monumental step in vertebrate evolution-the moment fins began to transform into limbs, setting the stage for the rise of amphibians, reptiles, and ultimately mammals.</string>
    <string name="devonian_ichthyostega_description">Ichthyostega was one of the earliest known tetrapods, representing a key stage in the transition of vertebrates from water to land. Measuring about 1.5 meters long, it retained many fish-like features-such as a tail fin, gills, and a lateral line system for detecting water vibrations-but also possessed robust limbs capable of supporting its body on land. Its forelimbs were strong and paddle-like, and its hind limbs were larger and more specialized for movement in shallow water or along muddy shorelines. The skull and teeth of Ichthyostega resembled those of early lobe-finned fishes, indicating it fed on aquatic prey. It likely spent most of its time in water but could haul itself onto land to bask or escape predators. Fossils discovered in Greenland have made Ichthyostega one of the most studied examples of early amphibian evolution. It illustrates the crucial evolutionary bridge between fully aquatic fishes like Tiktaalik and the first true land-dwelling vertebrates.</string>
    <string name="devonian_bothriolepis_description">Bothriolepis was a widespread genus of placoderms, or armored jawed fishes, that thrived in freshwater and nearshore environments during the Devonian Period. Reaching lengths of about 30 centimeters, it had a distinctive body divided into two parts: a heavily armored head and thorax protected by bony plates, and a flexible, scaleless tail used for swimming. Its mouth was positioned on the underside of its head, suggesting a bottom-dwelling lifestyle, where it likely fed on small invertebrates and organic debris in the sediment. Unlike many other placoderms, Bothriolepis had relatively weak jaws, but its paired fins and jointed armor gave it good mobility in shallow waters. Fossils are found on every continent, showing that it was one of the most successful vertebrates of its time. Bothriolepis represents the diversity and ecological adaptability of early jawed fishes, just before the Devonian’s mass extinction reshaped aquatic ecosystems.</string>
    <string name="devonian_cladoselache_description">Cladoselache was one of the earliest well-known sharks and a sleek, fast-swimming predator of the Paleozoic seas. Growing up to 2 meters long, it had a streamlined, torpedo-shaped body with a deeply forked tail, well-developed fins, and smooth skin that lacked the tough scales (denticles) of modern sharks. Its mouth was lined with multiple rows of sharp, grasping teeth, ideal for catching fish and cephalopods. Unlike many later sharks, Cladoselache had no claspers (mating organs) or heavy armor, suggesting a more primitive anatomy. It also had large eyes and a short snout, indicating a highly visual, active hunting lifestyle. Fossils found in the Cleveland Shale of Ohio preserve soft tissues, revealing details of its internal organs and even partially digested prey. Cladoselache represents one of the earliest true cartilaginous fishes, showcasing the efficient body plan that would make sharks successful marine predators for hundreds of millions of years.</string>
    <string name="devonian_dunkleosteus_description">Dunkleosteus is an extinct genus of armored placoderm fish that dominated the seas during the Late Devonian period - an era often called the “Age of Fishes,” when much of North America lay near the latitude of modern Rio de Janeiro. The largest species, Dunkleosteus terrelli, is regarded as Earth’s first vertebrate “superpredator.” First discovered on the shores of Lake Erie in 1867, Dunkleosteus has puzzled scientists for nearly 150 years. Because it was an arthrodire placoderm, only its heavily armored skull and jaw plates fossilized, while the rest of its body made mostly of cartilage - rarely preserved. Early reconstructions gave it a shark-like form and suggested lengths of up to 10 meters, but new research indicates those estimates were exaggerated. Based on comparisons with smaller, more complete relatives and the proportions of its 60-cm-long head, Dunkleosteus terrelli likely reached about 3.5-4 meters in length. This revision doesn’t diminish its fearsome reputation. Its body was likely short, thick, and powerful-more tuna-shaped than shark-shaped-with an enormous head and jaws lined with self-sharpening bony plates. The bite force has been estimated at over 6,000 newtons, among the strongest of any fish in history. A 3.5-meter Dunkleosteus may have weighed as much as a 4.5-meter great white shark, earning it the nickname “a wrecking ball with fins.” With a mouth nearly twice the size of a great white’s, it preyed on armored placoderms, ammonites, and early sharks, securing its place as the top predator of Devonian seas.</string>
    <string name="devonian_acanthostega_description">Acanthostega was one of the first vertebrates to possess true limbs with digits, making it a crucial transitional form between lobe-finned fishes and the first amphibians. Measuring about 60 centimeters long, it had a long, fish-like body with a tail fin, gills, and lateral line system-features suited for an aquatic lifestyle-but its limbs ended in eight digits, showing the early evolutionary experimentation that preceded modern tetrapod limb structures. Unlike later amphibians, Acanthostega’s limbs were too weak to support its body on land; instead, they were likely used for maneuvering among plants and debris in shallow water. Its skull and teeth indicate it was a predator, feeding on small aquatic animals. Fossils from Greenland have provided detailed insights into this species’ anatomy, revealing the sequence of adaptations that led from swimming to walking. Acanthostega exemplifies the water-to-land transition, demonstrating that limbs evolved in water first-long before vertebrates fully conquered the land.</string>
    <string name="devonian_materpiscis_description">Materpiscis attenboroughi was a small placoderm (armored fish) from Western Australia that made one of the most remarkable contributions to our understanding of vertebrate evolution-it provides the oldest known evidence of live birth (viviparity) in animals with backbones. Measuring about 25 centimeters long, Materpiscis had a body encased in bony armor typical of placoderms, with a jointed neck region and strong jaws lined with simple tooth plates for crushing prey. The name Materpiscis, meaning “mother fish,” comes from a fossil specimen found with an embryo still attached by an umbilical cord inside the body-clear proof that it gave birth to live young rather than laying eggs. This discovery revealed that internal fertilization and parental investment had evolved much earlier in vertebrate history than previously thought. Materpiscis lived in shallow tropical seas, where it likely preyed on small invertebrates. Its fossils, beautifully preserved in the Gogo Formation, provide an extraordinary glimpse into the early evolution of reproduction and maternal care among vertebrates.</string>
    <string name="devonian_jaekelopterus_description">Jaekelopterus was one of the largest arthropods to ever live, belonging to the group known as eurypterids or “sea scorpions.” With an estimated length of up to 2.5 meters, it was a top predator of Devonian rivers and estuaries. Its body was protected by a segmented exoskeleton, and it had powerful pincers at the front for seizing prey. Although related to modern horseshoe crabs and scorpions, Jaekelopterus was not a true scorpion. Fossil evidence suggests it inhabited brackish to freshwater environments, where it likely ambushed armored fish and other aquatic animals. Its sheer size and formidable claws make it one of the most iconic examples of Paleozoic “giant” arthropods, highlighting how different ecosystems were before the rise of land-dwelling vertebrate predators.</string>
    <string name="devonian_xenacanthus_description">Xenacanthus was an extinct genus of freshwater sharks that thrived in rivers and lakes for over 150 million years. Unlike the streamlined oceanic sharks we know today, Xenacanthus had a long, eel-like body and a distinctive spine projecting backward from the top of its head, possibly used for defense. Its dorsal fin extended along most of its back, giving it a ribbon-like silhouette. Fossil teeth suggest it fed on small fish and amphibians, adapted to freshwater ecosystems rather than open seas. Reaching lengths of around 1-2 meters, Xenacanthus was a successful and resilient predator, surviving multiple mass extinctions before disappearing in the Late Triassic.</string>
    <string name="devonian_calamophyton_description">Calamophyton was an early tree-like plant that played an important role in the greening of the Devonian landscape. It reached heights of about 2-4 meters and had a slender, branching trunk covered with short, twig-like branchlets. Unlike modern trees, it lacked true leaves, instead, its photosynthesis was carried out by these small branchlets. Calamophyton reproduced with spores and likely formed dense stands in floodplains and river valleys, stabilizing soils and creating new habitats for early terrestrial animals. Its presence contributed to the spread of forest-like ecosystems, influencing atmospheric oxygen levels and shaping the evolution of land life.</string>
    <string name="devonian_elkinsia_description">Elkinsia is considered the earliest known seed plant, marking a crucial evolutionary step in the history of life on land. Unlike spore-bearing plants, Elkinsia produced seeds-protective structures that allowed embryos to survive in harsher, drier environments and spread more effectively. It was a small, shrubby plant with branched stems and fern-like fronds that carried the ovules from which seeds developed. Fossils of Elkinsia, discovered in West Virginia (USA), show cup-shaped structures that enclosed the developing seeds, offering the first glimpse into how this innovation began. Though modest in appearance, Elkinsia’s reproductive breakthrough paved the way for the rise of vast forests of seed plants, including conifers and flowering plants, that would later dominate Earth’s ecosystems.</string>
    <string name="devonian_rhynia_description">Rhynia was one of the earliest and best-preserved vascular plants, playing a key role in the development of early terrestrial ecosystems. Standing about 20 centimeters tall, it had slender, leafless, branching stems that grew from horizontal underground stems (rhizomes). The stems contained xylem and phloem, specialized tissues that transported water and nutrients - an essential adaptation for life on land. Rhynia reproduced by spores produced in small, rounded sporangia at the tips of its branches. It lived in wet, marshy environments, likely along the banks of ancient hot springs, where its remains were fossilized in fine volcanic sediments that preserved its cellular structure in exquisite detail. These fossils, discovered near Rhynie, Scotland, form part of the famous Rhynie Chert, one of the most important fossil sites for studying early land life. Rhynia represents a crucial evolutionary step toward more complex land plants, bridging the gap between simple moss-like ancestors and the first vascular forests.</string>
    <string name="devonian_brontoscorpio_description">Brontoscorpio is a fossil arthropod from terrestrial sediments in what is now Worcestershire, England. The only known specimen is a large pedipalp finger (about 10 cm long) from which the full animal is estimated at ~0.8-1 m in length. The fossil was once interpreted as a sea scorpion (eurypterid) and a giant predator, but current evidence places it in the Arachnida, likely a scorpion-relative, and its full ecology remains uncertain. Because the material is fragmentary, its precise lifestyle - whether fully terrestrial, semi-aquatic, or aquatic - cannot be firmly established. The discovery remains notable for suggesting that arthropods of significant size existed very early in Devonian terrestrial ecosystems.</string>
    <string name="devonian_panderichthys_description">Panderichthys was a large, lobe-finned fish that played a crucial role in the evolutionary transition from aquatic to terrestrial vertebrates. Reaching about 1-1.5 meters in length, it lived in shallow coastal lagoons and river-delta environments across what is now Latvia. Its body was elongated and flattened, with eyes positioned high on the skull - an adaptation for lurking just beneath the water’s surface like a modern crocodile.\nAnatomically, Panderichthys represents a near-tetrapod stage in evolution. Its paired fins contained robust bones corresponding to the humerus, radius, and ulna, foreshadowing the limbs of early land vertebrates. Its skull and shoulder girdle show several tetrapod-like features as well, including reduced gill arches and a more mobile head region. Despite this, it still retained distinct fish characteristics such as fin rays and a tail designed for swimming.\nPanderichthys likely hunted small fish and aquatic invertebrates in shallow water, using ambush tactics. Its mixed anatomy - nearly halfway between fish and amphibians - makes it an essential transitional form, preceding more derived species like Tiktaalik and early tetrapods such as Acanthostega and Ichthyostega.</string>

    <string name="carboniferous_lepidodendron_description">Lepidodendron was a towering, tree-sized lycopsid plant that dominated the swampy coal forests of the Carboniferous Period. Often called a “scale tree,” it could grow over 30 meters tall with a trunk up to 1 meter in diameter, making it one of the largest plants of its time. Its name refers to the diamond-shaped leaf scars that covered the trunk and branches, creating a distinctive scaly pattern that makes its fossils easy to recognize.\nUnlike modern trees, Lepidodendron had a relatively thin layer of wood and relied on a massive outer bark-like tissue for structural support. It produced long, narrow leaves and reproduced using large cone-like structures (strobili) that released spores rather than seeds. The root system, known as Stigmaria, spread widely through the waterlogged soils of ancient peat swamps.\nLepidodendron and its relatives were major contributors to the organic material that eventually formed today’s coal deposits. These giant lycopsids flourished in humid, oxygen-rich environments but declined and went extinct as the Carboniferous rainforests collapsed toward the end of the period.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_sigillaria_description">Sigillaria was a tall, spore-bearing lycopsid plant that dominated the tropical coal swamps of the late Paleozoic Era. Similar to its better-known relative Lepidodendron, it could grow 20-30 meters tall, but it is easily distinguished by the rows of elongated, leaf-scar “seals” (sigillae) arranged in vertical patterns along its trunk, giving it a characteristic striped appearance.\nUnlike modern trees, Sigillaria had a hollow, bark-like outer structure for support and only a thin core of true wood. It bore long, grass-like leaves from the growing tip and produced reproductive cones (strobili) that released spores rather than seeds. Its root system, part of the widespread Stigmaria network, anchored it in the waterlogged soils of Carboniferous peat swamps.\nSigillaria thrived in warm, humid environments rich in ferns, horsetails, giant insects, and early amphibians. As the Carboniferous rainforests collapsed near the end of the period - due to climate shifts and glaciation - the great lycopsid trees declined and eventually went extinct.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_calamites_description">Calamites was a genus of large, tree-sized horsetails that flourished in the vast coal swamps of the Carboniferous Period. Related to modern horsetails (Equisetum) but far more impressive in size, these plants commonly reached 10-20 meters in height, with some even taller in exceptional circumstances. Their trunks were hollow, jointed, and ribbed, resembling giant bamboo, and they grew from extensive underground rhizomes that allowed entire groves to regenerate after storms or flooding.\nBranches sprouted in regular whorls from the nodes of the trunk, and narrow leaves formed brush-like clusters at the tips. Calamites reproduced using cone-like structures (strobili) that released spores, reflecting their ancestry among the early vascular plants before the evolution of seeds.\nThese horsetail trees thrived in riverbanks, floodplains, and swampy forests dominated by lycopsids like Lepidodendron and Sigillaria. Their fast growth and ability to resprout made them key components of Carboniferous ecosystems, contributing significantly to the organic material that later formed coal deposits.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_akmonistion_description">Akmonistion was a small, highly unusual holocephalan (a group that today includes chimaeras) belonging to an extinct lineage of ancient cartilaginous fishes. Known mainly from beautifully preserved fossils in the famous Mazon Creek deposits of Illinois, Akmonistion measured around 15-20 centimeters long but possessed a remarkably elaborate set of spines and “crowns” along its back. The most striking was the large, ornate dorsal fin spine with flaring, crown-like projections, features likely used for display or species recognition rather than defense.\nIts body was streamlined, with a long tail and pectoral fins suited for maneuvering in quiet coastal waters or estuaries. As a relative of early chimaera-like fishes, Akmonistion had a single gill opening on each side of the head and likely fed on small, soft-bodied invertebrates. The exceptional preservation of its body outline and fin structures in ironstone concretions makes Akmonistion one of the most visually distinctive fishes of the Carboniferous.\nThis species highlights the experimental diversity of early cartilaginous fishes, long before sharks and rays took the forms we know today. Its ornate fin spines suggest that even ancient fishes engaged in complex behaviors such as display, mate choice, or territorial signaling.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_helicoprion_description">Helicoprion was one of the most extraordinary cartilaginous fishes ever to evolve - a relative of modern chimaeras rather than true sharks. Its claim to fame is the bizarre “tooth whorl”: a spiral of continuously growing serrated teeth that curled like a circular saw inside the lower jaw. For over a century, scientists debated where this structure sat on the animal, but modern CT scans of rare skull material show that the whorl was positioned deep in the mouth, functioning as a slicing and grasping mechanism.\nReaching lengths of 5-8 meters, Helicoprion had a streamlined body and powerful tail suited for open-water hunting. Because its skeleton was made of cartilage, only the tooth whorls fossilized well, leaving its exact body shape uncertain - though it likely resembled other Permian chimaera-like fishes. The spiral teeth were probably used to catch and process soft-bodied prey such as cephalopods.\nFossils of Helicoprion are found across Russia, the western United States, China, and Australia, showing it had a broad global distribution before disappearing in the end-Permian mass extinction.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_pederpes_description">Pederpes was one of the earliest tetrapods to show clear adaptations for life on land after the Devonian fish-tetrapod transition. About 1 meter long, it had a sturdy body, a long tail, and well-developed limbs - especially the hind legs - which suggest it was capable of walking with a more modern, forward-facing stride. Unlike earlier tetrapods, whose feet pointed sideways like paddles, Pederpes had a narrower, inward-facing foot posture, allowing it to support its weight on land far more effectively.\nIts skull and teeth show that it remained a predator, likely feeding on insects, small amphibians, and aquatic prey along river margins. Although it still retained some primitive features - such as a partially aquatic lifestyle and a hearing system better suited to water - Pederpes represents a major step toward the fully terrestrial tetrapods of the Carboniferous forests.\nDiscovered in Scotland, its fossils are especially important because they come from Romer’s Gap, a 15-million-year interval with very few tetrapod fossils. Pederpes helps fill this gap, revealing how vertebrates refined their limbs and gait as they adapted to life on land following the Devonian extinction events.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_pterogyrinus_description">Proterogyrinus was a large, crocodile-like reptiliomorph - a close relative of the earliest amniotes (the group that later gave rise to reptiles, birds, and mammals). Reaching up to 2 meters in length, it had an elongated body, a powerful tail, and well-developed limbs, making it an agile predator in the rivers and swamps of Carboniferous North America and Europe.\nAlthough often described as amphibian-like, Proterogyrinus shows many features more advanced than those of true amphibians: reinforced vertebrae, strong limb joints, and a skull structure closer to early reptiles. It likely spent much of its time in water, using its long jaws studded with sharp teeth to catch fish and aquatic invertebrates, but it was also capable of moving effectively on land, more so than earlier tetrapods such as Ichthyostega or Acanthostega.\nIts streamlined body and robust limbs suggest it could pursue prey both in water and along muddy banks, filling a role similar to modern crocodilians or large salamanders. Proterogyrinus represents an important stage in tetrapod evolution: a versatile predator showing how early vertebrates transitioned from mostly aquatic ancestors toward the more terrestrial lifestyles of later amniotes.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_hylonomus_description">Hylonomus is widely regarded as the oldest known unquestionable reptile, marking a major milestone in vertebrate evolution, the emergence of true amniotes. Measuring only about 20-30 centimeters long, it was a small, lizard-like creature with slender limbs, a long tail, and sharp, conical teeth suited for eating insects and other small invertebrates. Unlike amphibians, Hylonomus laid amniotic eggs, which had protective membranes allowing them to develop entirely on land without the need for standing water. This adaptation opened the door for vertebrates to fully colonize terrestrial environments.\nFossils of Hylonomus are famously found inside hollow, fossilized stumps of giant lycopsid trees (Lepidodendron) in the coal forests of Joggins, Nova Scotia, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. These stumps likely acted as natural traps, preserving individuals that fell inside.\nHylonomus lived in lush tropical rainforests populated by enormous clubmoss trees, early conifers, giant insects, and amphibians. As one of the earliest amniotes, it represents the beginning of the lineage leading to all reptiles, birds, and mammals.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_archaeothyris_description">Archaeothyris was one of the earliest known synapsids - the ancient lineage that would eventually give rise to mammals. About 50-60 centimeters long, it resembled a small, agile lizard but is distinguished by a key mammal-like feature: a single temporal opening behind each eye, allowing stronger jaw muscles. This makes Archaeothyris one of the oldest representatives of the group that leads directly to later synapsids such as Dimetrodon, and ultimately to mammals.\nIt lived in the dense, humid coal forests of Nova Scotia, where it was likely an active predator feeding on insects, small amphibians, and other small vertebrates. Its sharp teeth and strong jaws suggest a carnivorous lifestyle, and its limb structure indicates it could move quickly along the forest floor. Though still primitive compared to later synapsids, Archaeothyris already showed the anatomical foundations that would be refined over hundreds of millions of years into the mammalian skull.\nFossils from the Joggins Formation place Archaeothyris among a rich community of early reptiles, amphibians, and synapsids, making it an essential species for understanding how the earliest amniote lineages began to diverge.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_pulmonoscorpius_description">Pulmonoscorpius was a giant prehistoric scorpion from the Carboniferous forests of what is now Scotland. Estimated to reach lengths of up to 70 centimeters, it was one of the largest scorpions known from the fossil record. Its body was divided into a broad front section with robust pincers and a long, segmented tail ending in a venomous stinger, features similar to modern scorpions but on a far grander scale.\nThe name Pulmonoscorpius (“lung scorpion”) reflects indirect fossil evidence suggesting it possessed book lungs, indicating it was well adapted for breathing air and living on land. During the Carboniferous, atmospheric oxygen levels were much higher than today, allowing arthropods to grow to exceptional sizes; Pulmonoscorpius is a classic example of this trend.\nIt likely lived as an ambush predator on the forest floor, hunting millipedes, insects, and perhaps even small amphibians. Fossils from the East Kirkton locality provide rare insights into the early evolution of terrestrial predators in the coal-age ecosystems.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_arthropleura_description">Arthropleura was the largest land arthropod ever known - a colossal, millipede-like creature that could reach 2-2.6 meters in length. It lived in the humid coal forests of Euramerica (parts of modern Europe and North America), crawling through dense undergrowth beneath towering lycopsids and horsetail trees. Its body was composed of dozens of articulated segments, each protected by broad, overlapping plates, giving it a heavily armored and flexible exoskeleton well suited for navigating the forest floor.\nDespite its intimidating size, Arthropleura was almost certainly herbivorous or detritivorous, feeding on decaying plant matter, fallen leaves, and possibly soft vegetation. Studies of its trackways and the environments in which it lived strongly suggest it avoided water and was primarily terrestrial, unlike many modern millipedes that require damp microhabitats.\nIts enormous size was made possible by the high oxygen levels of the Carboniferous atmosphere, which allowed arthropods to grow far larger than they can today. As climates became drier and oxygen levels fell toward the end of the Carboniferous, Arthropleura gradually declined and disappeared by the Early Permian.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_meganeura_description">Meganeura was one of the largest flying insects in Earth’s history - an enormous dragonfly-like predator with a wingspan reaching 65-70 centimeters. Belonging to the extinct order Meganisoptera, it resembled modern dragonflies but was not a direct ancestor. Its long, membranous wings and powerful flight muscles made it an agile hunter in the humid coal forests that once covered much of Europe.\nWith large compound eyes, spiny legs, and powerful mandibles, Meganeura was a skilled aerial predator, capturing other insects - and possibly small amphibians - on the wing. Its massive size was enabled by the high atmospheric oxygen levels of the Carboniferous, which allowed arthropods to grow far larger than is possible today.\nFossils discovered in France and England show that Meganeura lived in swampy ecosystems rich in giant ferns, clubmoss trees, and early reptiles.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_megarachne_description">Megarachne was once thought to be a giant prehistoric spider, but further fossil study revealed it was actually a eurypterid, or “sea scorpion”, closely related to other aquatic arthropods like Jaekelopterus. Measuring about 54 centimeters (21 inches) in length, it was far smaller than originally imagined, yet still an impressive predator for its time. Megarachne had a broad, rounded body, large grasping appendages for catching prey, and a flattened, paddle-like tail segment that helped it swim through the freshwater rivers and swamps of ancient South America. Its strong claws and sharp spines made it effective at capturing fish and other small aquatic animals. The initial misidentification as a spider fueled its fame, but the true identity of Megarachne tells a more accurate - and equally fascinating story about arthropod diversity in the Carboniferous Period, an era rich in giant insects and lush coal-forming forests.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_edestus_description">Edestus was a prehistoric shark-like fish known for its bizarre, curved tooth blades that projected forward from both the upper and lower jaws. Unlike modern sharks, it didn’t continuously replace individual teeth-instead, the entire tooth row grew forward over time, creating a scissor-like cutting mechanism. Measuring up to 6 meters (20 feet) long, Edestus was a formidable predator in the warm, coal-rich seas and river deltas of the Late Carboniferous. Its unusual dentition has earned it the nickname “scissor-toothed shark,” and paleontologists believe it sliced through soft-bodied prey such as fish and cephalopods with powerful jaw movements. Fossils of Edestus have been found in North America, Europe, and Russia, revealing its wide distribution during an era when ancient oceans teemed with diverse early vertebrates.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_anthracosaurus_description">Anthracosaurus was a large, crocodile-like tetrapod that lived in the coal swamps and river systems of Carboniferous Europe, particularly what is now Scotland. It belonged to the anthracosaurian reptiliomorphs - amphibian-like vertebrates that were closer to the ancestry of amniotes (the group including reptiles, birds, and mammals) than to modern amphibians. Growing up to 2-2.5 meters long, Anthracosaurus had a broad, flattened skull lined with sharp, labyrinthodont teeth ideal for catching fish. Its powerful jaws and elongated body suggest it was an ambush predator, lurking in deep water much like a modern crocodile or giant salamander.\nAlthough it spent most of its life in the water, Anthracosaurus had robust limbs and skeletal features indicating it may have been capable of limited movement on land, though not as efficiently as true reptiles. Fossils from the famous East Kirkton and Scottish coal deposits show that this animal lived in humid, forested ecosystems dominated by giant lycopsids and early insects. Anthracosaurus represents an important stage in tetrapod evolution - part of the lineage experimenting with traits that would ultimately lead to fully terrestrial vertebrates.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_edaphosaurus_description">Edaphosaurus was a large, herbivorous synapsid, an early relative of mammals, that lived in the swampy floodplains and upland environments of what is now North America and Europe. Reaching lengths of 3-3.5 meters, it is best known for the tall sail on its back, formed by elongated vertebral spines connected by skin. Unlike the sharp, blade-like spines of its carnivorous cousin Dimetrodon, Edaphosaurus’ spines were adorned with distinctive crossbars, giving the sail a unique, brush-like appearance. The function of this structure remains debated; proposed roles include thermoregulation, display, or species recognition.\nEdaphosaurus had a small head with blunt, peg-like teeth and crushing surfaces adapted for eating tough vegetation such as ferns and seed plants. Its barrel-shaped body and sturdy limbs indicate a slow-moving lifestyle, grazing on abundant Permian plant life. As one of the earliest known large herbivores among land vertebrates, Edaphosaurus played a key ecological role in early terrestrial ecosystems, long before true dinosaurs or mammals appeared.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_orthacanthus_description">Orthacanthus was a long-bodied, freshwater shark-like xenacanthid that inhabited the rivers, lakes, and swamps of ancient Euramerica. Reaching lengths of 2-3 meters, it had an unmistakable eel-like form with a continuous dorsal fin running along its back, giving it a serpentine swimming style very unlike modern sharks.\nOne of its most distinctive features was the spine on the back of its head, a long, backward-curving structure that may have been used for defense and was likely equipped with grooves suggesting the presence of venom - a rare trait for sharks. Its teeth were also unusual: double-crowned, tricuspid teeth ideal for gripping slippery prey.\nAs an apex predator in freshwater ecosystems, Orthacanthus fed on fish, amphibians, and even early tetrapods. Coprolites (fossilized dung) associated with xenacanthids contain fragmentary remains of early amphibians, reinforcing its role as a dominant hunter of swampy environments.\nIt thrived in environments where saltwater sharks seldom ventured, making xenacanthids one of the few shark lineages specialized for long-term freshwater life. Orthacanthus disappeared in the early Permian as ecosystems dried and changed, but it remains an iconic representative of Paleozoic freshwater predators - strange, eel-shaped “sharks” unlike anything alive today.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_crassigyrinus_description">Crassigyrinus was a bizarre, highly specialized early tetrapod that lived in the swampy freshwater environments of Carboniferous Scotland. Despite being part of the tetrapod lineage, it had a long, eel-like body and reduced, paddle-like limbs, suggesting it had returned almost entirely to an aquatic lifestyle. At about 2-3 meters long, it was a powerful predator in the dark, murky waters of coal-forest ecosystems.\nIts skull was large, broad, and heavily built, equipped with strong jaws lined with sharp, conical teeth ideal for catching slippery prey such as fish and early amphibians. The eyes were positioned toward the top of the head - an adaptation similar to crocodiles - allowing it to lurk beneath the water’s surface while watching for prey.\nThe limb reduction in Crassigyrinus shows that early tetrapod evolution was not a simple march toward land: some lineages experimented with going back to a fully aquatic lifestyle. Its anatomy represents a unique evolutionary pathway, one where limbs became less useful than a flexible, streamlined body for navigating dense underwater vegetation and peat-swamp channels.</string>

    <string name="permian_glossopteris_description">Glossopteris was a widespread and ecologically important genus of seed ferns (Pteridospermatophyta) that dominated the cool, temperate forests of the southern supercontinent Gondwana during the Permian Period. Recognizable by its distinctive tongue-shaped leaves with a central midrib and fine, branching veins, Glossopteris grew as part of shrubs or small trees that could reach several meters in height. Unlike true ferns, it reproduced with seeds, which were borne on specialized structures attached to the leaves.\nThese plants thrived in regions that are today South America, Africa, India, Antarctica, and Australia, forming the basis for the famous “Glossopteris flora.” Their broad geographic distribution across now separated continents provided some of the strongest early evidence for continental drift, long before plate tectonics was understood.\nGlossopteris played a major role in the coal-forming wetlands of the Permian, contributing enormous amounts of organic material. The group vanished abruptly during the end-Permian mass extinction, marking the collapse of the Gondwanan ecosystems and clearing the way for Mesozoic plant groups like cycads, ginkgos, and conifers.</string>
    <string name="permian_dimetrodon_description">Dimetrodon was a large, carnivorous synapsid, a member of the lineage that would eventually give rise to mammals, not a dinosaur, despite how often it appears alongside them in popular culture. Reaching lengths of 3-4.5 meters, Dimetrodon had a powerful, sprawling body, a long tail, and a massive skull filled with sharp, serrated teeth ideal for cutting flesh.\nIts most iconic feature was the tall sail on its back, formed by elongated neural spines connected by skin. Although still debated, the sail may have functioned in thermoregulation (absorbing or shedding heat), display, or species recognition. The spines themselves were vascularized, supporting the idea that the sail played a physiological role.\nDimetrodon lived in river valleys and floodplains of what is now the southern United States and Germany, where it was the top predator of its ecosystem. It preyed on amphibians, early reptiles, and other synapsids. Its skull shows early signs of mammal-line evolution, including a large temporal opening behind the eye for stronger jaw muscles - one of the defining traits of synapsids.</string>
    <string name="permian_titanophoneus_description">Titanophoneus was a large, predatory therapsid - a member of the mammal-line synapsids, belonging to the dinocephalians, a group known for their bulky bodies and thickened skull bones. Reaching lengths of 3-5 meters, it was one of the dominant carnivores of the Middle Permian ecosystems of what is now Russia. Its name, meaning “titanic murderer,” reflects its role as a top predator.\nTitanophoneus had a long, low skull armed with sharp, saber-like canine teeth and strong jaw muscles for dispatching large prey. Its limbs were more sprawling than those of later therapsids but showed signs of improvement toward a more upright gait. This combination gave it both the power to wrestle with large herbivores and the agility to chase or ambush smaller animals.\nIt lived alongside other early therapsids such as Estemmenosuchus and early parareptiles, hunting in warm, river-floodplain environments dominated by ferns, seed ferns, and early conifers.</string>
    <string name="permian_estemmenosuchus_description">Estemmenosuchus was one of the strangest and most visually striking therapsids of the Middle Permian. Belonging to the dinocephalians - massive, thick-skulled relatives of early mammals. It lived in what is now Russia and reached lengths of 3-4 meters, with a bulky, barrel-shaped body and strong, sprawling limbs.\nIts most distinctive feature was its ornate skull, decorated with large bony horns and plate-like projections that extended from the cheeks and top of the head. These structures were likely used for display, species recognition, or intraspecific combat, rather than for defense against predators. Despite its intimidating appearance, the shape of its teeth suggests that Estemmenosuchus was primarily herbivorous, feeding on lush Permian vegetation such as ferns, seed ferns, and early conifers.\nThis large, slow-moving animal inhabited warm floodplains and river valleys, sharing its environment with predators like Titanophoneus.</string>
    <string name="permian_gorgonops_description">Gorgonops was a swift, predatory therapsid - a distant, ancient relative of mammals, and one of the top carnivores of the Late Permian. Typically around 1.2-1.5 meters long, it had a sleek, agile body, long limbs, and a narrow, elongated skull equipped with massive saber-like canine teeth. These formidable fangs made Gorgonops an efficient hunter capable of delivering deep, lethal bites to large prey.\nUnlike the bulkier dinocephalians that came before it, Gorgonops was built for speed and active pursuit, more comparable in lifestyle to a mammalian predator than to earlier, sprawling Permian carnivores. It preyed on a wide variety of contemporaries, including dicynodonts, pareiasaurs, and smaller therapsids. Its posture was semi-upright, allowing for faster locomotion than most of its competitors.\nGorgonops lived in the dry, seasonal environments of Late Permian South Africa, part of an ecosystem on the brink of the end-Permian mass extinction, the largest extinction event in Earth’s history. The gorgonopsians as a whole perished in this crisis, but they represent a crucial stage in mammal-line evolution: the rise of agile, warm-climate, sabre-toothed predators millions of years before true mammals appeared.</string>
    <string name="permian_eryops_description">Eryops was a large, semi-aquatic amphibian and one of the dominant predators of the Early Permian swamps and floodplains. Growing up to 2 meters long, it had a broad, flat skull filled with sharp, conical teeth ideal for gripping slippery prey like fish. Its sturdy body and strong limbs suggest it could haul itself onto land, though it likely spent much of its time in or near water. Eryops breathed air with well-developed lungs, but its lifestyle was similar to that of modern crocodiles - lurking at the water’s edge to ambush prey. Fossils of Eryops are most famously found in Texas and New Mexico, providing insight into the early evolution of large terrestrial vertebrates.</string>
    <string name="permian_diplocaulus_description">Diplocaulus was a distinctive amphibian best known for its boomerang-shaped head, formed by long, sideways extensions of its skull. Growing up to about 1 meter in length, this unusual head shape may have helped it glide through water more efficiently or deter predators by making it harder to swallow. Diplocaulus lived in rivers and lakes, where it likely fed on small fish, insects, and other aquatic animals. Its fossils have been found mainly in North America and Morocco. As one of the most recognizable Paleozoic amphibians, Diplocaulus illustrates the experimental diversity of early tetrapods long before the dominance of dinosaurs.</string>
    <string name="permian_moschops_description">Moschops was a large, heavy-bodied therapsid belonging to the tapinocephalid dinocephalians, some of the most massive herbivores of the Permian. Growing up to 2.5-3 meters long and built like a squat, muscular cow, Moschops had a thick torso, sturdy limbs, and a short tail, well suited for a slow but powerful gait across the floodplains of ancient South Africa.\nThe most distinctive feature of Moschops was its extraordinarily thickened skull roof, strengthened by dense bone. This suggests that individuals may have engaged in head-butting behavior, similar to modern musk oxen, possibly for dominance, mating rights, or territorial interactions. Its teeth were broad and leaf-shaped, ideal for cropping tough Permian vegetation such as ferns, seed ferns, and early conifers.\nMochops inhabited warm, seasonally arid landscapes shared with other therapsids such as Estemmenosuchus, Titanocephalus, and gorgonopsians. As one of the largest herbivores of its time and among the earliest large land vertebrates to evolve complex social or combat behaviors, it represents a major step in the ecological diversification of pre-mammalian synapsids.</string>
    <string name="permian_eunotosaurus_description">Eunotosaurus was a small, lizard-like parareptile from South Africa that has become crucial to understanding the early evolution of turtles. Measuring about 30-40 centimeters long, it had a broad, flattened body with unusually wide and overlapping ribs - far wider than in any other reptile of its time. These ribs formed a rigid, proto-shell-like structure, providing an early glimpse of the body plan that would eventually give rise to the turtle carapace.\nAlthough Eunotosaurus lacked a true shell, it possessed several turtle-like traits:\n1. Broad, T-shaped ribs that restricted lateral breathing, hinting at early changes in respiratory mechanics.\n2. Reduced intercostal muscles, a precursor to the unique breathing system of modern turtles.\n3. A shortened trunk and muscular limbs suited for digging, suggesting a burrowing lifestyle.\nIt lived in semi-arid Permian environments with scattered vegetation and shared its habitat with dicynodonts, gorgonopsians, and other early synapsids and reptiles. Its unusual rib structure likely served as protection and provided stability during burrowing.\nFor many years, Eunotosaurus was considered an evolutionary enigma, but it is now widely regarded as an important stem-turtle - part of the lineage leading toward fully shelled turtles of the Triassic, such as Odontochelys and Proganochelys. It represents a key stage in the gradual assembly of the turtle body plan, demonstrating that the turtle shell began evolving long before the Mesozoic.</string>

    <string name="triassic_bennettitales_description">Bennettitales were an extinct order of seed plants that flourished throughout the Mesozoic Era, often forming part of the lush landscapes inhabited by dinosaurs. They closely resembled modern cycads, with stout trunks and crowns of tough, pinnate leaves, but are best known for their elaborate, flower-like reproductive structures. These cone-like organs contained both male and female parts and bore a striking resemblance to the flowers of later angiosperms. Despite this similarity, Bennettitales were more closely related to cycads, ginkgos, and conifers than to true flowering plants. Their exact evolutionary position remains debated-while most scientists do not consider them direct ancestors of angiosperms, some studies suggest that certain Bennettitales and early flowering plants may share a common ancestry. Fossil evidence also hints that some species were pollinated by insects, representing one of the earliest known plant-insect relationships. The group disappeared by the end of the Cretaceous, possibly due to competition from rapidly diversifying flowering plants.</string>
    <string name="triassic_morganucodon_description">Morganucodon was one of the earliest known mammals, bridging the evolutionary gap between reptile-like synapsids and true mammals. About the size of a shrew (10-15 cm long), it had a slender body, long tail, and large eyes suited for nocturnal life. Fossils discovered in Wales, China, and South Africa reveal key mammalian features such as a differentiated set of teeth (incisors, canines, premolars, and molars) and a three-boned middle ear derived from jaw bones of its ancestors-both hallmarks of modern mammals. Morganucodon likely fed on insects and small invertebrates, using its acute hearing and quick reflexes to hunt at night. It represents an important stage in mammalian evolution, showcasing the development of warm-blooded metabolism, parental care, and complex jaw mechanics that would later define the mammalian lineage.</string>
    <string name="triassic_lystrosaurus_description">Lystrosaurus was a small, tusked herbivore belonging to the dicynodonts-mammal-like synapsids that survived the catastrophic end-Permian extinction. About 1 meter long, it had a sturdy, barrel-shaped body, short legs, and a blunt snout tipped with a horny beak used for cropping tough plants. Its simple yet efficient design allowed it to thrive in harsh, drought-prone environments where few other large animals survived. Fossils of Lystrosaurus are found across Antarctica, Africa, Asia, and India, showing that it was both widespread and incredibly adaptable. Remarkably, it is estimated to have made up over 70% of some Early Triassic terrestrial vertebrate fossils, making it one of the most dominant land animals in Earth’s history. Lystrosaurus symbolizes resilience and recovery in the aftermath of the greatest mass extinction, bridging the evolutionary path toward the rise of mammals.</string>
    <string name="triassic_pterosauria_description">Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight, dominating the skies for more than 160 million years. This diverse order of flying reptiles included everything from sparrow-sized insect hunters to giants with wingspans over 10 meters. Their wings were formed by a membrane of skin stretched along an elongated fourth finger, supported by a lightweight skeleton and air-filled bones that made flight possible. Early pterosaurs like Eudimorphodon had long tails and toothed jaws, while later forms such as Pteranodon and Quetzalcoatlus evolved toothless beaks and highly specialized body shapes. Pterosaurs filled a wide range of ecological niches-fishers, scavengers, filter-feeders, and even terrestrial stalkers. Though often mistaken for dinosaurs, they were a distinct branch of archosaurs and close relatives of them. Pterosauria went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous, alongside non-avian dinosaurs, marking the end of Earth’s first great age of flying vertebrates.</string>
    <string name="triassic_plesiosauria_description">Plesiosauria were a group of marine reptiles that ruled the oceans during the Mesozoic Era. They were not dinosaurs but close relatives within the archosaur lineage. Plesiosaurs are instantly recognizable by their unique body plan-broad, turtle-like bodies with four strong, paddle-shaped limbs adapted for underwater “flight.” The group included two major forms: long-necked plesiosaurs such as Elasmosaurus, which likely hunted small fish and cephalopods with quick strikes, and short-necked pliosaurs such as Kronosaurus, which evolved massive jaws for hunting large prey. Most species were powerful swimmers capable of deep dives, and fossilized stomach contents show they were active predators rather than sluggish floaters. Some evidence also suggests they may have been warm-blooded. Plesiosaurs lived in seas across the globe, from Europe and North America to Antarctica. They disappeared at the end of the Cretaceous, victims of the same mass extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs.</string>
    <string name="triassic_ichthyosauria_description">Ichthyosaurs were a diverse order of marine reptiles that evolved soon after the Permian extinction and became the dominant predators of the Mesozoic seas long before plesiosaurs or mosasaurs appeared. Their name means “fish lizards,” and they indeed looked like a blend of reptile and dolphin-streamlined bodies, long snouts, and powerful tails built for fast swimming. Early ichthyosaurs, such as Mixosaurus, still showed some lizard-like features, while later forms, like Ophthalmosaurus and Temnodontosaurus, were highly specialized, with large eyes for deep-sea vision and live birth adaptations suited to a fully aquatic life. They fed on fish, cephalopods, and other marine animals, hunting with agility and speed. Ichthyosaurs reached lengths of up to 20 meters and developed dolphin-like fins and tail flukes long before mammals evolved similar shapes-a striking example of convergent evolution. They vanished in the Late Cretaceous, possibly due to changing ocean conditions and competition with emerging marine reptile groups.</string>
    <string name="triassic_mystriosuchus_description">Mystriosuchus was a long-snouted, semi-aquatic reptile belonging to the phytosaurs-a group of crocodile-like archosaurs that thrived before true crocodiles evolved. It measured around 4-5 meters in length, with a slender body, powerful tail, and jaws lined with sharp, conical teeth adapted for catching fish and other aquatic prey. Although it looked almost identical to modern crocodiles, Mystriosuchus and its relatives were only distant cousins, an excellent example of convergent evolution. Its nostrils were positioned near the eyes rather than at the tip of the snout, a key feature distinguishing phytosaurs from true crocodilians. Fossils of Mystriosuchus have been found in Europe and India, suggesting it inhabited rivers and lakes in warm, subtropical environments. As one of the last and most specialized phytosaurs, it represents the peak of this lineage before their extinction at the end of the Triassic.</string>
    <string name="triassic_plateosaurus_description">Plateosaurus was one of the earliest large herbivorous dinosaurs and a member of the prosauropods-the forerunners of the giant sauropods that would later dominate the Jurassic. It reached lengths of 7-10 meters and could weigh up to 4 tons. Fossil evidence suggests they commonly lived for at least 12 to 20 years. With a long neck, small head, and powerful hind limbs, Plateosaurus could rear up on two legs to browse vegetation at different heights. Its hands had strong claws, possibly used for grasping plants or defending itself. Fossils are widespread across Europe, especially in Germany and Switzerland, where dozens of well-preserved skeletons have been discovered, providing key insights into early dinosaur biology. Plateosaurus represents one of the first great evolutionary experiments in large-bodied plant-eating dinosaurs, showing how these animals began to adapt for bulk feeding long before their gigantic descendants appeared.</string>
    <string name="triassic_desmatosuchus_description">Desmatosuchus was a heavily armored aetosaur-an early relative of crocodiles-that lived in the floodplains of what is now the southwestern United States. Growing up to 5 meters long, it had a broad, low body covered in thick rows of bony plates (osteoderms) for protection. Its most distinctive features were the long, curved shoulder spines projecting from its armor, which may have been used for defense or display. Despite its fearsome appearance, Desmatosuchus was a herbivore, using its pig-like snout and peg-shaped teeth to root through soil and vegetation for plants and roots. It lived alongside early dinosaurs and other Triassic reptiles, representing a branch of armored archosaurs that filled the role of large, plant-eating browsers before the rise of the sauropods.</string>
    <string name="triassic_longisquama_description">Longisquama was a small, enigmatic reptile from Central Asia, notable for the long, feather-like scales that projected from its back. These structures, which could reach several times the length of its body, were probably used for display, species recognition, or thermoregulation rather than flight. Measuring only about 15 centimeters long, Longisquama had a lightweight skeleton and grasping limbs suited for climbing, suggesting it lived among the trees of tropical Triassic forests. Its fossil remains have fueled debate for decades over whether these elongated scales might represent early precursors to feathers. While most paleontologists now agree that Longisquama was not a direct ancestor of birds, its anatomy shows that complex body coverings evolved independently in several reptile lineages long before true feathers appeared in dinosaurs.</string>
    <string name="triassic_sharovipteryx_description">Sharovipteryx was a small, gliding reptile from what is now Central Asia, remarkable for its unique wing arrangement. Unlike most gliding animals, its main gliding membrane stretched between its elongated hind limbs, forming a “delta-wing” shape-essentially making it a “flying lizard with wings on its legs.” Additional smaller membranes on its forelimbs may have helped with steering. Measuring about 20 centimeters long, Sharovipteryx likely lived among trees and cliffs, gliding between them to escape predators or search for insects. Its unusual anatomy shows that many Triassic reptiles were experimenting with different ways to conquer the air long before true pterosaurs evolved powered flight. Fossils of Sharovipteryx provide a fascinating glimpse into the diversity of aerial adaptations in early reptiles.</string>
    <string name="triassic_tanystropheus_description">Tanystropheus was one of the most unusual reptiles of the Triassic, instantly recognizable by its extraordinarily long neck-up to 3 meters in some individuals, nearly three times the length of its body. It reached total lengths of around 5-6 meters and had a slender, semi-aquatic build. The neck contained only 13 elongated vertebrae, forming a stiff structure that it likely used to ambush prey from a distance while keeping most of its body hidden underwater. Its sharp, conical teeth suggest a diet of fish and squid. Fossils of Tanystropheus have been found around the ancient Tethys coastline in Europe, the Middle East, and China. Recent studies show there were both small, fully aquatic species and larger, amphibious ones, indicating ecological diversity within the genus. Tanystropheus exemplifies the evolutionary experimentation of the Triassic, when reptiles were diversifying into bizarre and specialized forms.</string>
    <string name="triassic_atopodentatus_description">Atopodentatus was one of the strangest reptiles of the Triassic seas, known for its bizarre, hammer-shaped snout lined with comb-like teeth. Growing up to 3 meters long, it used this unusual jaw structure to scrape or filter algae from rocks and sediments, making it one of the earliest known large herbivorous marine reptiles. Unlike the fearsome predators that dominated its world, Atopodentatus filled a very different ecological role, helping to maintain balance in coastal ecosystems. Fossils discovered in Yunnan, China, reveal its unique feeding adaptations, showing that marine reptiles experimented with a wide range of lifestyles soon after the end-Permian mass extinction.</string>
    <string name="triassic_herrerasaurus_description">Herrerasaurus was one of the earliest known dinosaurs, living in what is now Argentina during the Late Triassic. Reaching up to 6 meters in length, it was a lightly built, fast, and agile predator. Its long tail provided balance while running, and its sharp teeth and claws made it well suited for hunting smaller reptiles and early herbivorous dinosaurs. Despite being among the first dinosaurs, Herrerasaurus already showed many traits later seen in theropods, the group that would eventually include giants like Tyrannosaurus rex and modern birds. Its discovery has been key in understanding the early evolution and diversification of dinosaurs at the dawn of their dominance.</string>
    <string name="triassic_postosuchus_description">Postosuchus was a large, crocodile-like reptile belonging to the rauisuchians, a group of archosaurs more closely related to crocodiles than to dinosaurs. Growing up to 5-6 meters long, it was among the top predators of its time, preying on early dinosaurs and other reptiles. Its massive skull, filled with serrated teeth, and strong hind limbs suggest it could walk on all fours but may have reared up on two legs when running or attacking. Fossils of Postosuchus are mainly found in the southwestern United States, especially Texas, where it lived in floodplains and river valleys. As one of the dominant hunters of the Late Triassic, Postosuchus shows that dinosaurs were not always the rulers of their ecosystems, but instead rose to prominence only after competitors like rauisuchians went extinct.</string>
    <string name="triassic_shonisaurus_description">Shonisaurus was a giant ichthyosaur, a group of marine reptiles that superficially resembled dolphins. It reached extraordinary lengths of 15-20 meters, making it one of the largest oceanic predators of the Triassic seas. Unlike some later ichthyosaurs, Shonisaurus had a long, slender body, a narrow snout, and relatively small teeth, suggesting it fed mainly on soft-bodied prey like squid rather than armored fish. Fossils have been discovered in Nevada, USA, where entire bone beds preserve multiple individuals, hinting that these giants may have lived or migrated in groups. As an early marine reptile adapted to a fully aquatic life, Shonisaurus illustrates how reptiles rapidly diversified to dominate the oceans after the end-Permian extinction.</string>
    <string name="triassic_nothosaurus_description">Nothosaurus was a semi-aquatic marine reptile that lived along the shallow coasts of the Tethys Ocean. Measuring 3-6 meters long, it had a slender, lizard-like body with webbed feet and a long tail, making it a capable swimmer. Its elongated jaws were filled with sharp, interlocking teeth, perfect for catching slippery prey such as fish and squid. Nothosaurus likely spent much of its time in the water but could also haul itself onto land, similar to modern seals. It is considered an early relative of plesiosaurs, showing the evolutionary transition from coastal reptiles to the fully aquatic giants that would later dominate the Mesozoic seas. Fossils of Nothosaurus have been found across Europe, the Middle East, and China, highlighting its wide distribution in Triassic seas.</string>
    <string name="triassic_mixosaurus_description">Mixosaurus was a small to medium-sized ichthyosaur, measuring around 1-2 meters long, that represents a key transitional form in the evolution of these marine reptiles. Unlike its more dolphin-shaped descendants, Mixosaurus still retained a lizard-like body outline with a relatively long tail and less streamlined shape, but it also had adaptations for efficient swimming in open seas. Its conical teeth suggest it fed on fish and squid, hunting actively in coastal waters. Fossils of Mixosaurus have been discovered across Europe, Asia, and North America, showing that it was one of the first ichthyosaurs to achieve a global distribution. By bridging early, less specialized ichthyosaurs with the later, highly adapted forms, Mixosaurus illustrates the rapid evolutionary experimentation of reptiles in Triassic oceans.</string>
    <string name="triassic_hyperodapedon_description">Hyperodapedon was a stocky, beaked reptile belonging to the rhynchosaurs - herbivorous archosauromorphs that flourished during the Triassic before the rise of dinosaurs. Measuring up to 1.3 meters in length, it had a broad, triangular skull with powerful jaws and rows of chisel-shaped teeth adapted for slicing through tough, fibrous plants such as seed ferns and cycads. Its body was low to the ground, with strong limbs suited for digging or moving through dense vegetation. Fossils of Hyperodapedon have been discovered in South America, Europe, India, and Africa, showing it was one of the most widespread reptiles of its time. As one of the last and most specialized rhynchosaurs, Hyperodapedon represents the peak of this once dominant herbivorous lineage before their extinction at the end of the Triassic.</string>
    <string name="triassic_placerias_description">Placerias was one of the largest herbivorous reptiles of the Late Triassic, belonging to the dicynodonts - a group of tusked, beaked synapsids more closely related to mammals than to reptiles. It grew up to 3.5 meters long and weighed around a ton, with a barrel-shaped body, strong limbs, and a short tail. Its mouth was equipped with a horny beak and a pair of downward-pointing tusks, likely used for digging up roots or for display and combat. Placerias lived in river valleys and floodplains of what is now North America, feeding on tough vegetation during seasonal droughts. As one of the last surviving dicynodonts, it represents the final chapter of a lineage that had dominated herbivorous niches for over 100 million years before being replaced by dinosaurs.</string>
    <string name="triassic_stagonolepis_description">Stagonolepis was a heavily armored reptile belonging to the aetosaur group - early relatives of crocodiles that lived during the Late Triassic. It grew up to 3 meters long and was covered in thick, bony plates (osteoderms) arranged in rows along its back and sides, forming a natural shield against predators. Its body was low and broad, with short limbs and a long tail. Unlike its fearsome appearance, Stagonolepis was a herbivore: it had a pig-like snout and specialized teeth for rooting in soft soil and feeding on plants, roots, and tubers. Fossils have been found in Scotland, Poland, and the southwestern United States, showing that it was a widespread and successful member of early archosaur ecosystems. Stagonolepis illustrates the great diversity of crocodile-line reptiles before true dinosaurs became dominant.</string>
    <string name="triassic_thrinaxodon_description">Thrinaxodon was a small, burrowing synapsid - a close relative of early mammals that lived shortly after the catastrophic end-Permian extinction. Measuring about 50 centimeters long, it had a compact body, short legs, and a long tail, well adapted for digging and sheltering underground. Its skull showed several mammal-like features, including differentiated teeth (incisors, canines, and molars) and a secondary palate that allowed it to breathe while chewing. These traits mark Thrinaxodon as a key transitional form in the evolution from reptile-like synapsids to true mammals. Fossils found in South Africa and Antarctica often preserve individuals in curled, resting postures inside fossilized burrows-evidence of its burrowing lifestyle and possible warm-bloodedness. Thrinaxodon represents resilience and evolutionary innovation in the harsh world following Earth’s greatest mass extinction.</string>
    <string name="triassic_fasolasuchus_description">Fasolasuchus was a giant predatory rauisuchian, part of a group of crocodile-line archosaurs that dominated terrestrial ecosystems before dinosaurs rose to prominence. Known from fossils in Argentina, it is one of the largest terrestrial predators of the Triassic, reaching an estimated 8-10 meters in length, comparable to or even exceeding the size of many later theropod dinosaurs.\nUnlike crocodiles, Fasolasuchus had a fully upright, pillar-erect limb posture, with limbs positioned directly beneath the body. This allowed it to move efficiently on land and likely gave it a powerful, long-striding gait. Its skull was long and deep, lined with sharp, laterally compressed teeth designed for slicing flesh, indicating it hunted large contemporaries such as early dinosaurs, dicynodonts, and other archosaurs.\nAs a member of the rauisuchids, Fasolasuchus belonged to a lineage that occupied the apex predator role across Pangaea during the Middle and Late Triassic. These animals disappeared around the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, clearing ecological space that would soon be filled by large theropod dinosaurs.\nFasolasuchus stands as a dramatic example of the pre-dinosaurian giants, crocodilian-like archosaurs that once ruled the continents and reached sizes unmatched again until the age of the big carnivorous dinosaurs.</string>
    <string name="triassic_staurikosaurus_description">Staurikosaurus was one of the earliest known theropod dinosaurs, living in what is now southern Brazil during the Late Triassic. Small and lightly built, it measured around 2 meters in length and likely weighed under 30 kilograms. Despite its modest size, it was an agile, fast-running carnivore with long hindlimbs and a very long tail used for balance during rapid pursuit.\nIts skull was slender and armed with sharp, serrated teeth suited for slicing meat. Staurikosaurus likely preyed on small vertebrates such as early reptiles, amphibians, and juvenile archosaurs. Unlike later theropods, its hands had only two functional fingers, each tipped with claws for grasping prey, hinting at the anatomical experimentation characteristic of early dinosaur evolution.\nFossils found in the Santa Maria Formation of Brazil place Staurikosaurus among the earliest branches of the theropod lineage, alongside species such as Herrerasaurus. Though not a direct ancestor of later theropods, it provides essential insight into the dawn of dinosaur evolution, when small, swift predators were just beginning to appear in the fragmented ecosystems of the Late Triassic.</string>
    <string name="triassic_coelophysis_description">Coelophysis was one of the earliest well-known theropod dinosaurs and an important representative of the first wave of small, agile predators that emerged during the Late Triassic. Measuring around 2-3 meters long but weighing only about 20-30 kilograms, it had a slender, lightweight build with hollow bones, reflected in its name, which means “hollow form”.\nIts long legs, flexible neck, and stiff balancing tail indicate that Coelophysis was a fast, maneuverable runner, likely hunting small reptiles, amphibians, insects, and early mammal relatives. Its skull was narrow with sharp, serrated teeth ideal for a carnivorous diet. Large eye sockets suggest keen vision, and its forelimbs were equipped with grasping hands useful for capturing quick-moving prey.\nFossils from the Ghost Ranch quarry in New Mexico have yielded hundreds of skeletons, providing one of the most detailed snapshots of an early dinosaur species. These mass death assemblages may represent drought-related die-offs or herd behavior, hinting that Coelophysis could have been at least loosely social.\nAs one of the first successful theropods, Coelophysis set the stage for the later rise of Jurassic predators.</string>

    <string name="jurassic_archaeopteryx_description">Archaeopteryx is a genus of bird-like dinosaurs that represents a transitional form between non-avian feathered dinosaurs and modern birds. The largest individuals may have resembled modern ravens in size and shape, but they also had jaws with sharp teeth, three clawed fingers on each wing, and a long, bony tail-traits inherited from their dinosaur ancestors.</string>
    <string name="jurassic_allosaurus_description">Allosaurus was a large bipedal predator that could grow up to 8.5 meters in length and was likely near the top of the Jurassic food chain. Its potential prey included ornithopods, stegosaurids, and juvenile or weakened sauropods. Some paleontologists suggest that Allosaurus may have exhibited cooperative behavior and hunted in groups, while others believe individuals were solitary and that multiple fossils found together may represent scavenging at a shared carcass. It may have ambushed large prey, using its powerful jaws in a hatchet-like motion to deliver slashing bites.</string>
    <string name="jurassic_mamenchisaurus_description">Mamenchisaurus was a genus of sauropod dinosaurs known for its extraordinarily long neck, which could make up about half of its total body length. The largest species may have reached up to 35 meters in length and possibly weighed between 50 and 75 tons. Its neck likely helped it feed across a wide area without needing to move its massive body, possibly giving it access to high or scattered vegetation in Jurassic forests.</string>
    <string name="jurassic_stegosaurus_description">Stegosaurus is a genus of armored dinosaurs known for their distinctive double row of large, bony plates along the back and the spiked tail, or thagomizer. These large, heavily built herbivores likely used their plates for thermoregulation, species recognition, or display rather than defense. The first Stegosaurus specimen was discovered during the “Bone Wars”-the famous fossil rivalry between paleontologists Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh in the late 19th century.</string>
    <string name="jurassic_epidexipteryx_description">Epidexipteryx was a small, bird-like dinosaur that represents one of the earliest known examples of ornamental feathers in the fossil record. These long, ribbon-like tail feathers were likely used for display, possibly in mating rituals or for species recognition, rather than for flight.</string>
    <string name="jurassic_dilophosaurus_description">Dilophosaurus was one of the largest predators of the Early Jurassic period and is easily recognized by the pair of rounded crests on its skull. It measured around 7 meters in length and weighed approximately 400 kilograms. This dinosaur was inaccurately portrayed in the movie Jurassic Park-it did not have neck frills, could not spit venom, and was significantly larger than shown in the film.</string>
    <string name="jurassic_dimorphodon_description">Dimorphodon was a medium-sized pterosaur that likely lived in coastal regions during the Early Jurassic period. It had relatively short wings compared to other pterosaurs, suggesting it was not a strong flier. Instead, it may have relied on quick, flapping bursts of flight similar to those of modern chickens or woodpeckers. Its name means “two-form tooth,” referring to its distinctive combination of long and short teeth.</string>
    <string name="jurassic_epidendrosaurus_description">Epidendrosaurus was a sparrow-sized, feathered avialan dinosaur that likely lived in trees and fed on insects. It had elongated fingers with curved claws, which may have helped it climb or grasp branches. As one of the earliest known tree-dwelling dinosaurs, Epidendrosaurus provides important clues about the evolution of flight-related adaptations in birds.</string>
    <string name="jurassic_liopleurodon_description">Liopleurodon was a genus of large, carnivorous marine reptiles belonging to the Pliosauridae family, a subgroup of Plesiosauria. Fossils have been found mainly in England and France. Liopleurodon was a powerful swimmer, with strong flippers and a streamlined body, and typically grew to about 5-7 meters in length, though some fragmentary remains suggest the possibility of larger individuals.</string>
    <string name="jurassic_kentrosaurus_description">Kentrosaurus is a genus of stegosaurian dinosaur from the Late Jurassic period, known from fossils found in what is now Tanzania. It measured around 4.5 meters in length and weighed about one tonne. Kentrosaurus was a herbivore and likely lived in an environment with many predators, as suggested by its defensive adaptations-including a double row of plates and spikes along its back and tail, which may have served both protection and display functions.</string>
    <string name="jurassic_metriacanthosaurus_description">Metriacanthosaurus was a large theropod dinosaur from what is now England, reaching about 8 meters in length. Its name means “moderately spined lizard,” referring to the neural spines on its back vertebrae, which were taller than usual but not as extreme as those of sail-backed dinosaurs like Spinosaurus. As a carnivorous predator, it hunted other dinosaurs in its environment, possibly including stegosaurs and smaller sauropods. Although known from fragmentary remains, Metriacanthosaurus is classified as a member of the allosauroid group, making it a relative of the more famous Allosaurus. Its discovery highlights the diversity of large predatory dinosaurs roaming Europe during the Late Jurassic.</string>
    <string name="jurassic_diplodocus_description">Diplodocus was one of the longest dinosaurs ever discovered, a giant sauropod that could reach lengths of over 25 meters. It had an extraordinarily long neck and tail, with a relatively small head perched at the end of its slender neck. Its peg-like teeth were positioned at the front of the jaws, adapted for stripping leaves and soft vegetation rather than chewing. Diplodocus likely used its whip-like tail for defense or communication, and its posture allowed it to graze both low-lying plants and, by rearing up, higher vegetation. Fossils have been found in the Morrison Formation of North America, a region famous for its rich assemblage of Late Jurassic dinosaurs. As one of the most iconic sauropods, Diplodocus embodies the grandeur and scale of the “Age of Giants.”</string>

    <string name="cretaceous_tyrannosaurus_description">Tyrannosaurus is arguably the most famous dinosaur, widely recognized from films such as “Jurassic Park” and “The Lost World.” It is also one of the best-represented large theropods in the fossil record. Tyrannosaurus lived during the Late Cretaceous in what is now western North America. The most complete specimen discovered measures approximately 12.3 meters in length and stands up to 3.7 meters tall.\nWhile no direct evidence of feathers has been found on Tyrannosaurus itself, many paleontologists believe it likely had feathers on at least some parts of its body, based on evidence from closely related species. Below is an artistic interpretation of T. rex.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_velociraptor_description">Velociraptor was a bipedal, feathered carnivore with a long, stiff tail and an enlarged, sickle-shaped claw on each hind foot. Like Tyrannosaurus, it is one of the most familiar dinosaurs thanks to its prominent role in the “Jurassic Park” films. In reality, however, Velociraptor was roughly the size of a large turkey - much smaller than the human-sized predators depicted in the movies. Fossil evidence confirms that real Velociraptors had feathers and were likely warm-blooded, sharing many traits with modern birds.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_spinosaurus_description">Spinosaurus was one of the largest known carnivorous dinosaurs - possibly even larger than Tyrannosaurus rex. It could grow up to 14.3 meters in length and weigh around 20 tonnes. Fossil evidence indicates that it primarily ate fish, and most scientists believe it hunted both on land and in water. Spinosaurus likely led a semi-aquatic lifestyle, similar to that of modern crocodiles, with adaptations such as paddle-like feet and a long, narrow snout ideal for catching prey in aquatic environments.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_pachycephalosaurus_description">Pachycephalosaurus was a bipedal herbivorous dinosaur best known for its extremely thick, domed skull roof, which could be over 25 centimeters thick. It lived during the Late Cretaceous and was among the last non-avian dinosaurs to exist before the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. Some scientists believe it may have used its thick skull for head-butting or display behavior, though this remains debated.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_triceratops_description">Triceratops was a herbivorous dinosaur and one of the last known non-avian dinosaurs, living during the very end of the Late Cretaceous. It is estimated that Triceratops could grow up to 9 meters in length, 3 meters in height, and weigh around 12 tonnes. It is easily recognized by its large bony frill and three facial horns, which may have been used for defense, mating displays, or social interactions within the species.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_ankylosaurus_description">Ankylosaurus was a genus of heavily armored dinosaurs and among the last surviving non-avian dinosaurs, living during the Late Cretaceous. Large individuals could reach up to 6.25 meters in length, 1.7 meters in height, and weigh around 6 tonnes. Ankylosaurus is most famous for its massive club-like tail, which may have been used for defense against predators like Tyrannosaurus.\nRecent fossil discoveries suggest that some ankylosaurs may have had countershading - a form of camouflage where the body is darker on top and lighter underneath - providing protection from predators. This indicates a high level of predation pressure during the final stages of the Cretaceous.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_mosasaurus_description">Mosasaurus was an extinct genus of large, carnivorous marine lizards that lived during the Late Cretaceous. It could grow up to 17 meters in length, making it one of the top predators of its time. Fossil evidence suggests that it lived near the ocean surface, where it hunted a wide range of prey, including fish, turtles, ammonites, smaller mosasaurs, seabirds, pterosaurs, and plesiosaurs. Its long, streamlined body and powerful tail made it an efficient swimmer, and it likely used ambush tactics to capture its prey.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_ammonite_description">Ammonites were an extinct group of marine mollusks, closely related to modern squids and octopuses. They are well-known for their spiral shells and are considered excellent index fossils because they evolved rapidly and were widespread. Ammonites first appeared in the Devonian Period and thrived for hundreds of millions of years. They are mentioned here because they were among the most iconic marine creatures to go extinct during the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_therizinosaurus_description">Therizinosaurus cheloniformis was a large and unusual theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous. It could reach up to 10 meters in length and weigh around 5 tonnes. Therizinosaurus is best known for its enormous claws - the longest of any known animal - which could grow up to 70 centimeters in length. Although it belonged to a group of theropods, which are typically carnivorous, Therizinosaurus was likely herbivorous, with long necks, small heads, and a beaked mouth adapted for browsing vegetation.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_tsintaosaurus_description">Tsintaosaurus was a herbivorous hadrosaurid dinosaur, easily recognized by its characteristic “duck-billed” snout and a battery of strong, closely packed teeth adapted for chewing tough vegetation. It measured about 10 meters in length and stood approximately 3.6 meters tall. Tsintaosaurus lived during the Late Cretaceous and may have had a hollow, unicorn-like crest on its head, although the structure and function of this crest remain subjects of scientific debate.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_deinocherus_description">Deinocheirus was a highly unusual dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous. It could grow up to 11 meters in length and weigh around 6.4 tonnes, making it one of the largest members of the ornithomimosaur group. It had a pair of massive arms with long claws, which were likely used for foraging, possibly to dig or gather plants. Fossil evidence suggests that Deinocheirus was omnivorous, feeding on a mix of plants, small animals, and possibly fish. It is also thought to have been a slow-moving animal with a bulky build and a sail-like structure along its back.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_quetzalcoatlus_description">Quetzalcoatlus was a giant pterosaur and one of the largest known flying animals of all time. Its name is derived from the Mesoamerican feathered serpent god, Quetzalcoatl. With an estimated wingspan of 10-11 meters, it likely stood around 3 meters tall when on the ground. Quetzalcoatlus lived during the Late Cretaceous and may have soared long distances using thermal air currents. Despite its size, it is believed to have been capable of flight and may have hunted small animals or scavenged for food on land.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_giganotosaurus_description">Giganotosaurus was a giant theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous in what is now Argentina. It was comparable in size - and possibly even slightly longer - than Tyrannosaurus rex, though it was more lightly built. Like Tyrannosaurus, it is believed to have had a metabolism somewhere between that of modern reptiles and mammals, allowing it to maintain a relatively stable body temperature. Giganotosaurus was likely a top predator in its ecosystem, preying on large herbivorous dinosaurs such as sauropods.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_linhenykus_description">Linhenykus is the only known non-avian dinosaur to have had a single functional finger. It was a small-bodied theropod that lived during the Late Cretaceous in what is now Mongolia. Although its body shape resembles that of a modern ostrich, it was not closely related to birds like ostriches. Linhenykus belonged to a group called alvarezsaurids, which were specialized for digging and may have used their single large claw to break into insect nests, such as those of termites.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_sarcosuchus_description">Sarcosuchus was an extinct genus of crocodyliform and a distant relative of modern crocodilians. It was one of the largest crocodile-like reptiles to have ever lived and existed during the Early Cretaceous in what is now Africa and South America. Sarcosuchus could grow up to 11-12 meters in length and weigh as much as 8 tonnes - nearly twice the size of today\'s saltwater crocodile. It lived in freshwater environments and likely hunted both aquatic prey such as fish and terrestrial animals, similar to the behavior of modern Nile crocodiles.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_microraptor_description">Microraptor was a genus of small, four-winged paravian dinosaurs that lived during the Early Cretaceous. Its exceptionally well-preserved fossils provide crucial evidence for the evolutionary link between birds and dinosaurs. Microraptor was one of the most abundant non-avialan dinosaurs in its ecosystem. Adult specimens are estimated to have reached up to 77 centimeters in length and weighed around 1 kilogram. It was an opportunistic predator that likely fed on small mammals, bird-like dinosaurs, lizards, and even fish, suggesting it may have been capable of gliding or controlled flight to ambush prey.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_pteranodon_description">Pteranodon was a large pterosaur, a flying reptile that soared over the inland seas of North America. With a wingspan of 5-7 meters, it was among the largest flying animals of its time. Unlike birds or bats, Pteranodon had wings formed from a skin membrane stretched along an elongated fourth finger. Its long, toothless beak was well suited for catching fish, which it likely skimmed from the ocean surface while gliding effortlessly on air currents. Males and females showed striking differences in size and the shape of their head crests, which may have been used for display or species recognition. Fossils from Kansas and surrounding regions have made Pteranodon one of the best-known pterosaurs, symbolizing the incredible diversity of flying reptiles during the Cretaceous.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_carnotaurus_description">Carnotaurus was a medium-sized theropod dinosaur from South America, notable for its unusual appearance. It measured about 7-8 meters long, with a lightly built body adapted for speed. Its most striking features were the short, blunt horns above its eyes - unique among large predatory dinosaurs, and its extremely reduced forelimbs, even smaller than those of Tyrannosaurus rex. Carnotaurus had a deep, muscular neck and a powerful bite, suggesting it was an active predator of large herbivorous dinosaurs. Fossilized skin impressions reveal rows of bony bumps along its body, giving it a reptilian, armored look. As one of the best-preserved abelisaurids, Carnotaurus provides key insights into the specialized predators that dominated Gondwana in the Late Cretaceous.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_saltasaurus_description">Saltasaurus was a medium-sized sauropod dinosaur that lived in what is now Argentina. Unlike its gigantic relatives such as Argentinosaurus, Saltasaurus reached a more modest length of about 12-14 meters. It was one of the first sauropods discovered with evidence of armor: small bony plates, called osteoderms, embedded in its skin. These likely served as protection against predators like abelisaurids. As a member of the titanosaur group, Saltasaurus was a long-necked herbivore that browsed on vegetation, helping to shape the ecosystems of Gondwana during the final stage of the Age of Dinosaurs. Its fossils have been crucial in showing that not all sauropods were enormous giants, and that some evolved defensive adaptations to survive alongside fierce predators.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_nigersaurus_description">Nigersaurus was a peculiar sauropod dinosaur from the Sahara Desert in what is now Niger. Reaching about 9 meters in length, it was relatively small for a sauropod. Its most striking feature was its wide, shovel-shaped muzzle lined with more than 500 slender teeth arranged in rows, which were continuously replaced. This adaptation allowed Nigersaurus to graze close to the ground, feeding on soft plants like ferns and horsetails, much like a prehistoric lawnmower. Unlike the towering, high-browsing sauropods, Nigersaurus specialized in low browsing, showing the diversity of feeding strategies among these long-necked dinosaurs. Fossils discovered in the Elrhaz Formation have made it one of the most unusual and fascinating plant-eaters of the Cretaceous.</string>

    <string name="paleogene_titanoboa_description">Titanoboa cerrejonensis was the largest snake ever known, slithering through the tropical rainforests of what is now Colombia about 8 million years after the extinction of the dinosaurs. It could reach lengths of up to 13 meters and weigh over a ton - roughly the size of a city bus. Titanoboa belonged to the boa family and likely lived in humid, swampy environments, where it hunted large prey such as crocodile-like reptiles and giant fish. Its immense size suggests it required the consistently warm climate of the Paleocene tropics to survive, as snakes rely on external heat to regulate their body temperature. The discovery of Titanoboa in the Cerrejón coal mines provided key evidence of ancient equatorial climates, showing that tropical regions were significantly hotter than today. As both a predator and a paleoenvironmental indicator, Titanoboa remains one of the most spectacular examples of post-dinosaur gigantism.</string>
    <string name="paleogene_gastornis_description">Gastornis was a giant, flightless bird that roamed the forests of Europe, North America, and Asia during the early Cenozoic. Standing up to 2 meters tall, it had powerful legs and a massive, deep beak capable of delivering a strong bite. For many years, paleontologists thought Gastornis was a fearsome predator, but more recent evidence such as the structure of its beak and isotopic analyses of its bones-suggests it was primarily herbivorous, feeding on tough vegetation, seeds, and possibly fruit. Its large size and strong build likely deterred predators, allowing it to dominate early post-dinosaur ecosystems. Gastornis represents an early example of giant birds evolving to fill ecological roles left vacant after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs, showcasing how quickly life rebounded in the Paleogene world.</string>
    <string name="paleogene_basilosaurus_description">Basilosaurus was one of the earliest fully aquatic whales and a top predator of the Late Eocene seas. Despite its name, which means “king lizard,” it was a true mammal and a distant ancestor of modern whales and dolphins. Growing up to 18 meters long, Basilosaurus had an elongated, serpentine body with small, functional hind limbs, remnants of its terrestrial ancestry. Its long jaws were lined with sharp, conical teeth adapted for seizing fish and smaller marine mammals. Fossils have been found in North America, North Africa, and the Middle East, particularly in Egypt’s Wadi Al-Hitan (“Valley of the Whales”), a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Basilosaurus marks a crucial stage in whale evolution, showing how mammals transitioned from land-dwelling ancestors to powerful oceanic hunters.</string>
    <string name="paleogene_paraceratherium_description">Paraceratherium was the largest land mammal ever known - a hornless relative of modern rhinoceroses that lived across Asia in open woodlands and floodplains. Standing about 5 meters tall at the shoulder and weighing up to 20 tons, it rivaled some dinosaurs in size. Its long neck and prehensile upper lip allowed it to browse on leaves high in the trees, much like a giraffe. Despite its immense size, Paraceratherium had a relatively lightweight skeleton for efficient movement and likely traveled long distances in search of food. Fossils found in Pakistan, Mongolia, China, and Central Asia reveal that it occupied vast regions once covered by subtropical forests. As a gentle giant of the Oligocene, Paraceratherium represents the peak of mammalian gigantism on land before climate shifts and habitat changes led to its extinction.</string>
    <string name="paleogene_daeodon_description">Daeodon was the largest member of the entelodonts - an extinct family of pig-like omnivorous mammals often nicknamed “hell pigs” or “terminator pigs.” Standing up to 1.8 meters tall at the shoulder and weighing around 900 kilograms, Daeodon had an enormous head nearly a meter long, powerful jaws, and massive teeth adapted for crushing bone, tearing flesh, and grinding plants. Despite their fearsome appearance, entelodonts were opportunistic feeders, eating anything from carrion and small animals to roots and fruit. Long limbs and cloven hooves suggest that Daeodon was a fast runner, capable of chasing down prey or scavenging across vast plains. Its fossils are found in the western United States, revealing that it was an apex omnivore in early North American ecosystems.</string>
    <string name="paleogene_pyrotherium_description">Pyrotherium was a large, hoofed mammal that lived in South America and is known for its distinctive, elephant-like appearance. It stood about 3 meters tall and weighed around 3 tons, with a bulky body, column-like legs, and a short trunk or flexible upper lip that it likely used to grasp vegetation. Its skull was long and flat, ending in two forward-pointing tusks formed from enlarged incisors. Despite superficial similarities, Pyrotherium was not closely related to elephants but belonged to an extinct order of South American mammals whose evolutionary relationships remain uncertain. It inhabited swampy lowlands and river plains, feeding on soft, aquatic plants. As one of the most mysterious members of South America’s unique prehistoric fauna, Pyrotherium highlights the continent’s long isolation and its tendency to produce evolutionary lineages found nowhere else on Earth.</string>
    <string name="paleogene_archaeotherium_description">Archaeotherium was a large, omnivorous entelodont - part of the so-called “hell pigs,” though it was more closely related to hippos and whales than to true pigs. It stood about 1.5 meters tall at the shoulder and weighed around 300-400 kilograms. Its massive head, armed with crushing jaws and sharp teeth, suggests a versatile diet that included meat, roots, carrion, and even bones. With long legs and a sturdy body, Archaeotherium was likely a fast, aggressive forager capable of both hunting and scavenging. Fossils from North America show that it lived in open woodlands and floodplains, sharing its environment with early horses, rhinoceroses, and predators. Bite marks on fossils of other animals hint that it may have used ambush tactics or driven competitors away from kills.</string>
    <string name="paleogene_arsinoitherium_description">Arsinoitherium was a large, rhinoceros-sized herbivorous mammal that lived in the tropical forests and swamps of northern Africa, particularly in what is now Egypt. It reached about 3 meters in length and weighed around 2 tons. Its most striking feature was a pair of massive, conical horns on its snout-composed of bone rather than keratin like those of modern rhinos-and a smaller pair of secondary horns behind them. Despite its rhino-like appearance, Arsinoitherium was not closely related to rhinos but instead belonged to the extinct order Embrithopoda, a group more distantly related to elephants, manatees, and hyraxes. Its teeth indicate a diet of soft, swampy vegetation, and it probably lived in herds near water sources. Fossils found in the Fayum Depression, a region rich in early mammal fossils, make Arsinoitherium an important species for understanding the early diversification of large mammals in Africa.</string>
    <string name="paleogene_brontotherium_description">Brontotherium was a massive, rhinoceros-like mammal belonging to the brontotheres, a group of large herbivores related to horses. It stood about 2.5 meters tall at the shoulder and could reach up to 5 meters in length. Its most distinctive feature was a pair of large, forked horns on its snout, formed from thickened bone, which were likely used in display or combat between males. Despite their size and power, brontotheres were strict plant-eaters, browsing on soft vegetation in the subtropical forests and floodplains of North America. Brontotherium and its relatives became extinct at the end of the Eocene, possibly due to climate change and the spread of new, tougher grasses that their teeth were not adapted to process.</string>
    <string name="paleogene_uintatherium_description">Uintatherium was a large, rhinoceros-like herbivorous mammal that lived in North America during the early Cenozoic. It reached up to 4 meters in length and weighed around 2 tons, making it one of the largest land animals of its time. Its skull was highly distinctive: males bore six bony knobs or blunt horn-like projections on their heads, and both sexes had long, saber-like upper canine teeth. These features may have been used in display, combat, or species recognition. Despite their fearsome appearance, Uintatherium fed on soft vegetation such as leaves and aquatic plants. It belonged to the extinct order Dinocerata, with no close modern relatives, and its fossils are especially abundant in Wyoming and Utah.</string>
    <string name="paleogene_hyaenodon_description">Hyaenodon was a genus of large carnivorous mammals belonging to the now-extinct group called creodonts. Despite its name, it was not related to modern hyenas but represented a separate lineage of predators that once dominated before modern carnivores (like cats and dogs) evolved. Species of Hyaenodon varied greatly in size, from jackal-like hunters to giants over 1.5 meters long with skulls nearly half a meter in length. They had long, narrow jaws filled with slicing teeth adapted for shearing flesh, making them specialized meat-eaters. Hyaenodon likely hunted and scavenged across open woodlands and plains of Eurasia, Africa, and North America. As top predators for millions of years, creodonts like Hyaenodon showcase the diversity of mammalian carnivores before being replaced by today’s carnivoran mammals.</string>
    <string name="paleogene_dorudon_description">Dorudon was an early whale that swam in the warm seas of the Late Eocene. Growing about 5 meters long, it was smaller than its close relative Basilosaurus but shared a similar elongated, streamlined body. Unlike modern whales, Dorudon still had small, functional hind limbs, a reminder of its land-dwelling ancestry, though these were too reduced to be used in walking. It was a skilled predator, feeding mainly on fish and small sharks. Fossils of Dorudon are especially well known from Egypt’s Wadi Al-Hitan (“Valley of the Whales”), where skeletons provide a clear picture of whale evolution from land mammals to fully aquatic giants. Dorudon illustrates the transition toward modern whales, bridging primitive archaeocetes and today’s toothed and baleen whales.</string>
    <string name="paleogene_hyrachyus_description">Hyrachyus was a small, early perissodactyl (odd-toed ungulate) that lived in North America, Europe, and Asia. About the size of a modern tapir, it stood around 1 meter tall and had a compact, sturdy body with three toes on each foot. It is considered one of the earliest known relatives of both rhinoceroses and tapirs, showing transitional traits between primitive herbivores and their more specialized descendants. Hyrachyus had a relatively simple, elongated skull with low-crowned teeth suited for browsing soft leaves and shoots in subtropical forests. Its build suggests it was an agile browser capable of moving through dense vegetation.</string>
    <string name="paleogene_otodus_description">Otodus was a genus of giant mackerel sharks that dominated the world’s oceans for over 50 million years. It originated in the early Eocene and is best known as the ancestor of the colossal Otodus megalodon, the largest predatory shark ever known. Early Otodus species reached lengths of up to 12 meters and had large, triangular teeth with smooth edges, which later evolved into the serrated forms seen in Megalodon. These sharks were apex predators, preying on large fish and early marine mammals. Their wide geographic range-from Europe and Africa to Asia and the Americas-shows they were highly adaptable to different marine environments. The lineage of Otodus illustrates the gradual evolution of gigantism and specialized feeding strategies among sharks, culminating in the apex predators that ruled Miocene and Pliocene seas.</string>
    <string name="paleogene_protocetus_description">Protocetus was an early whale that represents a crucial stage in the transition from land-dwelling mammals to fully aquatic cetaceans. Measuring around 2.5-3 meters in length, it retained functional hind limbs capable of supporting it on land, though its body was increasingly adapted for swimming. Its long, streamlined shape and powerful tail indicate that it was an agile swimmer, while its nostrils had begun to shift backward along the snout-a key evolutionary step toward the blowhole position in modern whales. Protocetus likely lived a semi-aquatic lifestyle, feeding on fish and other marine animals in warm coastal waters but possibly coming ashore to rest or breed. Fossils have been discovered in Egypt, Pakistan, and Nigeria, showing its widespread distribution across the ancient Tethys Ocean. As a member of the archaeocetes (primitive whales), Protocetus bridges the gap between amphibious ancestors like Ambulocetus and fully marine forms such as Basilosaurus.</string>
    <string name="paleogene_pelagornis_description">Pelagornis was a genus of enormous seabirds known for their remarkable size and distinctive “toothed” beaks. The largest species, Pelagornis sandersi, boasted an estimated wingspan of 6-7.5 meters, making it one of the biggest flying birds in Earth’s history. Its long, slender beak was lined with bony projections that looked like teeth, used to grasp slippery prey such as fish and squid. With lightweight bones and long, narrow wings, Pelagornis was perfectly adapted for dynamic soaring, gliding effortlessly over open oceans much like modern albatrosses. It ranged widely across ancient seas, with fossils found on every continent.</string>

    <string name="neogene_argentavis_description">Argentavis magnificens was one of the largest flying birds to ever exist, soaring over the plains of what is now Argentina. With an estimated wingspan of up to 7 meters and a weight of around 70 kilograms, it dwarfed any modern bird, including the Andean condor. Its long, broad wings and lightweight skeleton suggest it was a master of soaring flight, relying on rising air currents to travel vast distances with minimal effort - much like modern vultures and albatrosses. Argentavis likely fed as a scavenger or opportunistic predator, consuming carcasses or small prey located during its long glides. Its immense size pushed the limits of flight in terrestrial vertebrates, making it a remarkable example of how evolution repeatedly tested the boundaries of aerodynamics and biology.</string>
    <string name="neogene_ardipithecus_description">Ardipithecus is considered one of the earliest known ancestors of humans following the split from the main ape lineage, although its exact place in the evolutionary tree remains debated. It lived around 4.4 million years ago in what is now modern-day Ethiopia and shared some similarities with chimpanzees, such as a small brain size-ranging between 300 and 350 cm³, which is slightly smaller than that of modern chimpanzees and about 20% the size of a modern human brain. Despite these similarities, Ardipithecus also had features that distinguish it from chimpanzees, suggesting that the last common ancestor of humans and apes may not have looked like today’s chimpanzees. Notably, while chimpanzee feet are highly adapted for tree-climbing, Ardipithecus had a more versatile foot structure that allowed it to walk upright on the ground, marking an important step toward habitual bipedalism in human evolution.</string>
    <string name="neogene_megalodon_description">Carcharodon megalodon - commonly known as Megalodon - was the largest predatory shark to ever live. Reaching estimated lengths of up to 18 meters and weighing over 50 tons, it ruled the world’s oceans for more than 20 million years. Its massive jaws could span over 2 meters wide and were armed with serrated teeth the size of a human hand, capable of slicing through bone and flesh with ease. Megalodon likely preyed on whales, seals, and large fish, using ambush attacks powered by explosive bursts of speed. Fossils of its teeth and vertebrae have been found on every continent except Antarctica, revealing that it occupied warm, coastal waters worldwide. Though often linked to the modern great white shark, most scientists now classify Megalodon in its own extinct genus, Otodus (Otodus megalodon), reflecting its distinct evolutionary lineage. It disappeared around 3.6 million years ago, likely due to global cooling, shrinking habitats, and competition from emerging marine predators such as early killer whales.</string>
    <string name="neogene_levyatan_description">Livyatan was a gigantic extinct species of toothed whale, comparable in size to the modern sperm whale, reaching lengths of nearly 18 meters. Unlike today’s sperm whales, Livyatan had massive, functional teeth in both its upper and lower jaws-up to 36 cm long-used to hunt large prey, including other marine mammals. Alongside the giant shark megalodon, it was one of the top apex predators of the Miocene oceans.\nLivyatan likely went extinct due to oceanic cooling at the end of the Miocene, which led to a decline in warm-water prey species. Fossils of this whale have been discovered in marine formations that also contain a diverse array of marine life, including sharks, dolphins, and seals, offering a glimpse into the rich ecosystems of Neogene seas.</string>
    <string name="neogene_titanis_description">Titanis walleri was a large, flightless, carnivorous bird that lived in North America during the Late Neogene, around 5 to 2 million years ago. Standing about 2.5 meters tall and weighing roughly 150 kilograms, it was a formidable predator. Titanis belonged to a group of birds known as terror birds (Phorusrhacidae), which were dominant land predators in South America during much of the early and middle Cenozoic era. Unlike most of its relatives, Titanis migrated northward into North America during the Great American Biotic Interchange, after the formation of the Isthmus of Panama. It had strong legs for fast running and a powerful beak capable of delivering deadly blows, likely hunting small mammals and other prey.</string>
    <string name="neogene_deinotherium_description">Deinotherium was a massive prehistoric relative of modern elephants that ranged across Africa, Europe, and Asia. Standing up to 4.5 meters tall at the shoulder, it rivaled or even exceeded modern African elephants in size. Its most distinctive feature was a pair of large, downward-curving tusks attached to the lower jaw-unlike the upper tusks of modern elephants. These tusks were likely used for stripping bark, pulling down branches, or digging up roots. Deinotherium had a long trunk and a more primitive skull structure, linking it to early proboscideans from which all later elephants evolved. It thrived in warm, forested environments and persisted for nearly 18 million years before vanishing in the Pleistocene, likely due to climate changes that reduced its preferred habitats. As one of the last representatives of an ancient elephant lineage, Deinotherium showcases the deep evolutionary history of Earth’s largest land mammals.</string>
    <string name="neogene_platybelodon_description">Platybelodon was a remarkable member of the elephant family that lived across Africa, Asia, and North America during the Miocene. About 3 meters tall and weighing up to 4 tons, it is best known for its distinctive shovel-like lower jaw, tipped with broad, flat tusks. These tusks, together with a flexible trunk, were likely used to scoop up aquatic vegetation or strip bark from trees, earning it the nickname “shovel-tusked elephant.” Its upper tusks were shorter and curved upward, while its teeth were adapted for grinding coarse plant matter. Platybelodon lived in wet, lowland environments such as riverbanks and floodplains, where it fed on soft vegetation. It belonged to the gomphotheres, an extinct group of proboscideans that were early relatives of modern elephants. Although its strange jaw shape once puzzled scientists, it is now seen as a fascinating example of feeding specialization within the diverse history of elephant evolution.</string>
    <string name="neogene_stegotetrabelodon_description">Stegotetrabelodon was an early member of the elephant family (Elephantidae) and one of the first proboscideans to display the characteristic features of modern elephants. It stood about 4 meters tall and weighed around 10 tons, with a long trunk and four tusks - two large upper ones and two smaller lower ones, hence its name, which means “roofed four-tusked tooth.” The lower tusks were flattened and shovel-like, possibly used for digging or stripping vegetation, while the upper tusks were long and slightly curved. Fossils of Stegotetrabelodon have been discovered in Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Asia, suggesting it had a wide range. It lived in open woodlands and savannas, browsing on a variety of plants, and represents an important evolutionary stage between the earlier gomphotheres and the true elephants of the genus Elephas. Stegotetrabelodon marks the transition toward the modern elephant body plan and feeding adaptations that would dominate later in the Pleistocene.</string>
    <string name="neogene_gomphotherium_description">Gomphotherium was an ancient relative of elephants that roamed Africa, Eurasia, and North America. It stood about 3 meters tall at the shoulder and is best known for its four tusks - two on the upper jaw and two on the lower. The lower tusks were flattened and shovel-like, probably used for scooping plants or stripping bark. Unlike modern elephants, Gomphotherium had a shorter trunk and grazed on a wide range of vegetation, from grasses to aquatic plants. It was highly adaptable and spread across multiple continents, making it one of the most successful proboscideans of the Miocene. As a representative of early elephant evolution, Gomphotherium shows how diverse and experimental this group once was before modern elephants became dominant.</string>
    <string name="neogene_hipparion_description">Hipparion was a three-toed relative of modern horses that thrived across Africa, Eurasia, and North America. About the size of a pony, it stood around 1.4 meters tall at the shoulder. While it retained two small side toes in addition to its main hoof, it primarily ran on the central toe, a step toward the single-hoofed condition of modern horses. Hipparion was a swift grazer, well adapted to open grasslands that expanded during the Miocene. Fossils are abundant and widespread, showing that it was one of the most successful horse genera in prehistory. Its evolutionary position makes Hipparion an important link between earlier forest-dwelling horses and today’s specialized grazers.</string>
    <string name="neogene_sivatherium_description">Sivatherium was a massive prehistoric giraffid that lived across Africa and parts of the Indian subcontinent. Standing about 3 meters tall at the shoulder and weighing over a ton, it was far more robust than modern giraffes. Its most distinctive features were the four horn-like ossicones on its skull - two large, branching ones above the eyes and two smaller ones on the forehead, giving it a striking, almost moose-like appearance. Despite its bulk, Sivatherium was a browser, feeding on leaves, twigs, and shrubs. Its short neck compared to modern giraffes shows that giraffids once explored a wider range of body plans. Sivatherium survived into the Pleistocene and may have been encountered by early humans, possibly inspiring ancient rock art depictions.</string>
    <string name="neogene_machairodus_description">Machairodus was a large saber-toothed cat and one of the earliest members of the famous “saber-tooth” lineage. It lived across Africa, Eurasia, and North America, reaching lengths of up to 2 meters and weighing as much as a modern lion. Its most distinctive features were the long, curved upper canine teeth, which could grow over 20 cm and were adapted for delivering precise killing bites to the throats of large prey. Machairodus likely hunted in open woodlands and grasslands, preying on horses, antelopes, and other large herbivores. Though similar to the later Smilodon, it was more lightly built and probably relied on ambush tactics rather than sheer power. As a top predator of its time, Machairodus played a crucial role in shaping Miocene ecosystems and represents an important step in saber-tooth evolution.</string>
    <string name="neogene_thalassocnus_description">Thalassocnus was a remarkable genus of marine sloths that lived along the coasts of South America, particularly in what is now Peru and Chile. Unlike its tree-dwelling relatives, Thalassocnus gradually adapted to life in the water. Over millions of years, its species evolved heavier bones to counter buoyancy, powerful limbs for swimming, and a long, downward-curved snout suited for grazing on sea grasses and algae along the seafloor. Reaching lengths of about 2 meters, it occupied a unique niche similar to that of modern marine herbivores like manatees. Thalassocnus is an exceptional example of how land mammals repeatedly evolved to exploit marine environments, showcasing evolution in action across successive species.</string>
    <string name="neogene_toxodon_description">Toxodon was a large, heavy-bodied herbivorous mammal that lived throughout South America during the Pleistocene. It stood about 1.5 meters tall at the shoulder and weighed up to 1.5 tons, resembling a cross between a rhinoceros and a hippopotamus, though it was unrelated to either. Its broad chest, sturdy legs, and massive head with curved teeth suggest it grazed on tough vegetation in wetlands and open plains. Toxodon belonged to a group of South American mammals known as notoungulates, which evolved in isolation on the continent. Fossils found alongside human artifacts indicate that early people may have encountered - and possibly hunted - Toxodon before it went extinct at the end of the last Ice Age. Charles Darwin himself collected its fossils during his voyage on the Beagle, making Toxodon one of the first extinct mammals to spark modern ideas about evolution.</string>

    <string name="quaternary_mammutus_description">Mammoths were large mammals closely related to today\'s elephants, characterized by their thick insulating fur adapted for cold climates. Most mammoth species were roughly as large as modern Asian elephants, inhabiting vast areas of the northern hemisphere, including regions of Eurasia and North America. They primarily fed on grasses, shrubs, and small trees. Mammoths disappeared from Africa approximately 3–4 million years ago, and from Europe and mainland North America around 10,000 years ago. Remarkably, small populations persisted much longer, with the last known group surviving on Wrangel Island in the Arctic until about 3,750 years ago.\nThe extinction of mammoths was primarily driven by rapid climate warming around 12,000 years ago, which caused glaciers to retreat, sea levels to rise, and grassy tundra habitats—critical to mammoth survival—to diminish and be replaced by dense forests. Human hunting may also have played a role, especially in North America, where mammoths were actively hunted by early peoples, as evidenced by spearheads found alongside mammoth remains.\nToday, exciting scientific efforts are underway to potentially revive mammoths using advanced genetic techniques. Researchers in Japan and South Korea are independently working on extracting viable DNA from frozen mammoth remains to clone or genetically engineer mammoth-like creatures. Additionally, in northeastern Russia, the ambitious "Pleistocene Park" project led by scientist Sergey Zimov seeks to restore ancient ecosystems, preparing vast grasslands to potentially reintroduce cloned mammoths. This effort could even help slow Arctic permafrost melting by recreating conditions similar to those of the Ice Age. For further exploration, the VICE documentary titled "The Crazy Solution For Keeping The Melting Arctic Frozen" provides fascinating insights into this innovative ecological restoration initiative.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_coelodonta_description">Coelodonta, commonly known as the woolly rhinoceros, is an extinct genus of large, hairy rhinoceroses that roamed across Eurasia during the Pleistocene epoch. Equipped with thick fur, compact bodies, and large horns, these impressive animals were well-adapted to the harsh, cold environments of the Ice Age, grazing primarily on grasses and tundra vegetation. Like many other members of the Pleistocene megafauna, the woolly rhinoceros became extinct approximately 10,000 years ago, with the last known populations surviving in Western Siberia.\nWhile the exact reasons for their extinction remain debated, it is widely believed to be a combination of climatic shifts at the end of the Ice Age—resulting in significant habitat loss—and increased human activity, including hunting. Ancient cave paintings, such as those found in Chauvet Cave in France, vividly depict woolly rhinoceroses, demonstrating early humans\' familiarity with and perhaps admiration for these majestic creatures. Remarkably well-preserved remains, including fully intact carcasses with fur, skin, and even stomach contents, have been discovered in Siberian permafrost, providing extraordinary insights into their biology and lifestyle.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_megatherium_description">Megatherium was a genus of enormous ground sloths that roamed South America during the Pleistocene epoch. Comparable in size to modern elephants, Megatherium could weigh around 4 tonnes and reach lengths up to 6 meters. It inhabited diverse environments ranging from temperate grasslands to arid and semi-arid regions. With its powerful limbs, large claws, and robust tail for balance, it was perfectly adapted to feed on leaves and grasses, including plants like yuccas, agaves, and other tough vegetation.\nMegatherium became extinct approximately 10,000 years ago, likely due to habitat fragmentation and environmental changes associated with the end of the last Ice Age. However, human activity, such as hunting by early South American peoples, may have also contributed to their demise. Intriguingly, Megatherium fossils were among the first American fossils studied scientifically, described by Georges Cuvier in 1796. This impressive animal\'s skeletal remains astonished early naturalists and greatly influenced ideas about extinction and prehistoric life.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_smilodon_description">Smilodon, famously known as the saber-toothed cat, was one of the most iconic predators of the Quaternary Period. Roaming across the Americas until about 10,000 years ago, Smilodon was powerfully built, weighing up to 400 kilograms and standing around 120 cm at the shoulder. Its most distinctive features were the elongated canine teeth, some reaching lengths of nearly 30 centimeters, perfect for delivering devastating bites to large prey.\nSmilodon primarily hunted massive herbivores such as bison, camels, horses, and even juvenile mammoths, employing powerful limbs and muscular strength to wrestle prey to the ground. The extinction of Smilodon coincided closely with the disappearance of many large herbivores at the end of the last Ice Age, around 10,000 years ago. This was largely due to significant environmental shifts causing prey animals to become smaller, faster, and more elusive—conditions that favored quicker, lighter predators. Additionally, increased human competition and hunting pressure might have further accelerated their decline.\nInterestingly, thousands of exceptionally preserved Smilodon fossils have been recovered from the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, providing scientists with rare insights into the life and ecology of this fascinating predator.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_coelacanth_description">Latimeria, commonly known as the coelacanth, is an ancient lineage of lobe-finned fish often described as a "living fossil" because it closely resembles species known only from fossils over 360 million years old. Remarkably, coelacanths can live for 80 to 100 years and inhabit deep oceanic waters, often residing at depths of up to 700 meters. Their diet primarily consists of squid, small sharks, and other fishes.\nOne intriguing adaptation contributing to their survival is their ability to significantly slow down their metabolism, allowing them to conserve energy and survive long periods with minimal food. For many years, coelacanths were thought to have become extinct about 66 million years ago, until a living specimen was unexpectedly discovered off the coast of South Africa in 1938, astonishing the scientific community.\nToday, two known populations of coelacanths exist: one near Sodwana Bay in South Africa, and another around the Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean. Due to their elusive nature and deep-sea habitat, coelacanths remain rare and mysterious, continuing to captivate scientists with clues about the evolutionary transition from aquatic to terrestrial vertebrates.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_xiphosura_description">Xiphosura, the group that includes horseshoe crabs, has remained largely unchanged for hundreds of millions of years, earning them the nickname "living fossils." These ancient arthropods are more closely related to spiders and scorpions than to true crabs and share evolutionary roots with the extinct trilobites, another dominant arthropod group of the Paleozoic Era. Horseshoe crabs have a hard, dome-shaped shell, long tail spine (telson), and multiple pairs of legs and gills adapted for both crawling and underwater breathing.\nOne of their most remarkable features is their bright blue blood, which contains a substance called Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL). This compound is crucial in modern medicine, as it is used to test vaccines, IV drugs, and surgical implants for contamination by bacterial endotoxins. Thanks to this unique biological trait, horseshoe crabs have become essential for the safety of pharmaceutical products worldwide.\nDespite their importance, horseshoe crab populations face increasing threats from habitat loss, overharvesting for bait and biomedical use, and climate change. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these ancient creatures and ensure their survival into the future.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_ginkgo_description">Ginkgo is the only surviving species of the ancient plant division Ginkgophyta, earning it the nickname "living fossil." Fossil records show that Ginkgo trees have existed for over 270 million years, dating back to the Permian period. Once widespread across the globe, Ginkgo biloba is now native only to parts of China, where it was preserved in temple gardens and sacred groves for centuries.\nToday, Ginkgo is widely cultivated around the world for its distinctive fan-shaped leaves and exceptional resilience to pollution, pests, and disease. It holds cultural and medicinal significance, especially in traditional Chinese medicine, where its seeds and leaf extracts are used to support memory and circulation. Ginkgo nuts are also considered a delicacy in East Asian cuisine. Remarkably, some Ginkgo trees even survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, continuing to grow today as symbols of endurance and hope.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_welwitschia_description">Welwitschia is one of the three genera within the ancient plant division Gnetophyta and is often referred to as a "living fossil." Endemic to the Namib Desert in southwestern Africa, this remarkable plant is uniquely adapted to one of the harshest environments on Earth. Each individual Welwitschia plant produces only a single pair of strap-like leaves that grow continuously throughout its life, often becoming frayed and split over time.\nMany existing Welwitschia plants are estimated to be over 1,000 years old, with some believed to be more than 2,000 years old, making them among the longest-living plants in the world. Despite their strange appearance, Welwitschia plants are gymnosperms and are considered close relatives of modern flowering plants. Their ability to survive extreme aridity is supported by deep taproots and the absorption of moisture through specialized leaf surfaces.\nWelwitschia has fascinated scientists and botanists for centuries and is considered a national symbol in Namibia. Its slow growth, extreme longevity, and bizarre structure continue to intrigue researchers studying plant evolution and desert survival strategies.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_tuatara_description">Tuatara are unique reptiles endemic to New Zealand and are the only surviving members of the ancient reptile order Rhynchocephalia, which thrived around 200 million years ago during the age of the dinosaurs. Resembling lizards but genetically distinct, tuatara can grow up to 80 cm in length and weigh up to 1.3 kg. They are terrestrial and nocturnal, and unlike most reptiles, they thrive in cooler climates, remaining active at much lower temperatures. During the winter months, they enter a state of hibernation to conserve energy.\nTuatara are now classified as endangered, primarily due to habitat destruction and the introduction of invasive species such as rats, which prey on their eggs and juveniles. Conservation programs in New Zealand have been successful in protecting and reintroducing tuatara to predator-free offshore islands. Fascinatingly, tuatara possess a "third eye" (the parietal eye) on the top of their heads, visible in hatchlings, which may help regulate their circadian rhythms and hormone production. They also have one of the slowest growth and reproductive rates of any reptile, with some individuals living over 100 years. As living links to prehistoric reptiles, tuatara are often referred to as "living fossils" and are treasured symbols of New Zealand’s unique natural heritage.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_human_description">Human, or Homo sapiens, is the most successful large vertebrate species to ever roam the Earth. The estimated human population by 2017 was around 7.5 billion, and humans occupy most natural niches—except the deep oceans, salt lakes, deep caves, and Antarctica (although some specimens have been reported to live there, at least seasonally). It is currently listed as a species of “least concern” on the IUCN Red List of endangered species.\nTraditionally, there are two competing paleoanthropological theories about the origin of H. sapiens: the recent African origin and the multiregional origin. The more widely accepted single-origin theory states that modern humans appeared in East Africa and later migrated northward as glaciers retreated. They overwhelmed the northern-dwelling H. neanderthalensis, which were already suffering from reduced genetic diversity, and eventually migrated across the globe—killing and destroying most natural habitats and animal species in their path. Eventually, humans became apex, opportunistic predators. However, different human populations specialized in different types of food. For example: the Japanese are regarded as the most ferocious marine predators, killing thousands of whales, dolphins, sharks, and other sea animals each year; the Chinese are known for their passion for killing rhinoceroses, elephants, and other horned animals—they even recently wiped out the Northern White Rhinoceros in Africa, great job! European populations depleted their natural resources long ago, so they usually rely on other populations to bring them food and are best known for their manipulative skills, and so on.\nThe human creating this application is about 1.84 meters tall, weighs approximately 74 kilograms, and is alive thanks to photosynthesis.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_dodo_description">The dodo was a flightless bird endemic to the island of Mauritius, located east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. Standing about 1 meter tall and weighing up to 17 kg, the dodo was a close relative of modern pigeons and doves. Although often portrayed historically as fat and clumsy, the dodo was actually well-adapted to its predator-free island environment. It used gizzard stones to aid in the digestion of its diet, which mainly consisted of fallen fruits.\nThe first recorded mention of the dodo was by Dutch sailors in 1598. Over the following decades, it was hunted by humans and preyed upon by invasive species such as rats, pigs, and monkeys that were introduced to the island. Simultaneously, its forest habitat was rapidly destroyed. The last widely accepted sighting of a dodo occurred in 1662. Its extinction in less than a century after its discovery by Europeans became one of the earliest and most iconic examples of human-driven extinction.\nThe dodo\’s fate served as a powerful wake-up call to the scientific world, symbolizing the fragility of isolated ecosystems and the far-reaching impacts of human colonization and environmental disruption. Today, the dodo remains a global emblem of extinction and a lasting reminder of the importance of wildlife conservation.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_megalania_description">Megalania was a giant extinct lizard and a formidable member of the Pleistocene megafauna that once roamed southern Australia. Believed to have gone extinct around 50,000 years ago, it may have coexisted with the first Aboriginal settlers, who could have played a role in its disappearance. The largest individuals are estimated to have reached lengths of up to 7 meters and weighed between 600 and 620 kilograms, making Megalania the largest terrestrial lizard known to have ever lived.\nA powerful predator, Megalania fed primarily on medium to large-sized animals, including giant marsupials. It possessed strong limbs, a muscular tail, and a massive skull equipped with serrated, blade-like teeth capable of inflicting deep wounds. Some paleontologists suggest it may have had venom glands like its modern relative, the Komodo dragon, which would have made its bite even more lethal.\nMegalania\'s dominance in its ecosystem ended as Australia\'s climate shifted and human activities—including hunting and habitat modification—intensified. Its extinction marks one of many dramatic faunal changes following human arrival on the continent. Today, Megalania remains one of the most fascinating examples of prehistoric reptilian giants and a powerful symbol of Australia\'s lost megafauna.</string>
