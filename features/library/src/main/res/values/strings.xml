    <string name="hadean_description">Hadean Eon – the earliest period of Earth\'s history, spanning from the planet\'s formation approximately 4.56 billion years ago until the emergence of stable tectonic plates around 4.0 billion years ago.\nThe landscape of the Early Hadean was extremely hostile, resembling a hellish environment. The surface was dominated by widespread volcanic activity, molten rock, and frequent bombardment by meteorites and comets.\nThe first 100 million years were far too inhospitable for any form of life, with surface temperatures reaching around 230 degrees Celsius—and in the earliest stages, even exceeding 2000 degrees Celsius. Atmospheric pressure was estimated to be about 27 times higher than today. While Earth possessed a primitive atmosphere, it was repeatedly stripped away by intense collisions with other celestial bodies.\nAround 4.4 billion years ago, the planet began to cool, as evidenced by zircon crystals, which suggest the presence of liquid water during this period. The end of the Hadean Eon is marked by the stabilization of Earth\'s crust, the formation of early oceans, and the beginnings of continental crust.</string>
    <string name="hadean_additional_title"></string>
    <string name="hadean_additional"></string>
    <string name="hadean_life_forms">There is no definitive proof that life could have existed in such a harsh environment. However, 4.1-billion-year-old graphite deposits found in Western Australia contain carbon isotopes that suggest possible biological origins, indicating that conditions for life may have been sustainable earlier than previously thought. Some scientists hypothesize that life may have emerged multiple times during the Hadean Eon, only to be repeatedly annihilated by catastrophic asteroid impacts and extreme volcanic activity. Additionally, carbon-rich meteorites, which delivered organic molecules to early Earth, support the idea that the building blocks of life may have originated in space.</string>

    <string name="archean_physics">Mean temperature: 45&#8211;70 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 0%</string>
    <string name="archean_description">The Archean Eon – the second eon in Earth\'s history – spans from approximately 4.0 billion years ago, when the first tectonic plates began to form, to around 2.5 billion years ago, just before the Great Oxidation Event.\nAt the beginning of this eon, Earth\'s temperature was 2–3 times higher than today. This was primarily due to a high concentration of greenhouse gases (dozens of times higher than today) and residual heat from planetary accretion and core formation.\nDuring this period, the Sun\'s luminosity was about 70–75% of its present level, leading to a \"faint young Sun paradox\", which was mitigated by the greenhouse effect. By the end of the Archean, Earth\'s tectonic activity had evolved into a more modern-like system, and vast oceans of liquid water covered much of the planet, providing the conditions for the emergence of early microbial life.</string>
    <string name="archean_additional_title">Late heavy bombardment</string>
    <string name="archean_additional">Around 4.0 billion years ago, the planets of our solar system, including Earth, experienced intense bombardment by large cosmic bodies for approximately 200 million years. This period, known as the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB), is evidenced by lunar samples collected by Apollo astronauts, which contain high-impact melt formations.\nExtrapolating lunar cratering rates to Earth at this time suggests that the planet would have experienced:\n1. Approximately 22,000 craters with diameters greater than 20 km.\n2. Around 40 craters with diameters exceeding 1,000 km.\n3. Several craters with diameters close to 5,000 km.\nThe prevailing hypothesis for this bombardment is that the giant planets—such as Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune—underwent orbital migration. This gravitational disturbance scattered objects from the asteroid and/or Kuiper belts into eccentric orbits, increasing the impact rate on the inner planets. This event may have delayed the emergence of life during the Early Archean by creating a hostile surface environment through frequent, high-energy impacts.</string>
    <string name="archean_life_forms">Unlike in the Hadean, the presence of life during the Archean is well established, though the exact timing of its emergence remains debated.\nThe earliest solid evidence of life comes from 3.48-billion-year-old stromatolites found in Australia and 3.77–4.28-billion-year-old microfossils discovered in Canadian rocks. Additionally, 3.85-billion-year-old isotopic signatures in Greenland suggest biological activity, though their interpretation is contested.\nBanded iron formations (BIFs) also date back to this period. While some argue that their formation required oxygen from early photosynthetic microbes, others suggest alternative abiotic processes could have played a role.\nPossible early prokaryotes have been identified in Canadian rocks at least 3.77 billion years old, and lipid biomarker analysis suggests that the first eukaryotes may have emerged by the late Archean, around 2.7 billion years ago.</string>

    <string name="proterozoic_physics">Mean temperature: 5&#8211;45 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 0&#8211;12%</string>
    <string name="proterozoic_description">The Proterozoic Eon – the third major eon in Earth\'s history, spanning from approximately 2.5 billion to 541 million years ago, just before the widespread emergence of complex life. Key events of this eon include the transition to an oxygen-rich atmosphere during the Great Oxidation Event, multiple global glaciations (such as those associated with the Snowball Earth hypothesis during the Huronian, Sturtian, and Marinoan glaciations), and the evolution of early multicellular eukaryotic organisms, including soft-bodied life forms like those of the Ediacaran biota.\nThis is a hypothetical reconstruction of a Snowball Earth scenario during the Huronian and Cryogenian glaciations.</string>
    <string name="proterozoic_additional_title">Great Oxidation Event</string>
    <string name="proterozoic_additional">The Great Oxidation Event was the biologically induced rise of oxygen in Earth\'s atmosphere, occurring around 2.4 to 2.1 billion years ago. The widely accepted hypothesis states that the primary driver of this event was the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria.\nBefore this event, any free oxygen produced was rapidly consumed by chemical reactions with dissolved iron or organic matter. However, once these oxygen sinks became saturated, excess oxygen began accumulating in the atmosphere.\nFree oxygen is toxic to obligate anaerobic organisms, leading to a major extinction event. Additionally, atmospheric oxygen reacted with methane, a potent greenhouse gas, significantly lowering its concentration. This process likely triggered the Huronian glaciation, which lasted approximately 300 million years (from ~2.4 to ~2.1 billion years ago).\nThese profound changes in Earth\'s atmospheric and chemical cycles created new evolutionary pressures and opportunities. Life adapted first to tolerate and then to harness atmospheric oxygen, leading to the development of aerobic respiration. This metabolic breakthrough vastly increased the available energy supply, enabling the evolution of more complex, multicellular organisms.</string>
    <string name="proterozoic_life_forms">The Proterozoic Eon marks a crucial transition in the evolution of life, from simple unicellular organisms to more complex forms. During the Great Oxidation Event, many anaerobic organisms declined due to oxygen toxicity, while oxygen-tolerant and aerobic life forms, including early eukaryotic protists and bacteria, proliferated. By the mid-Proterozoic, stromatolites—microbial reef-like structures built by cyanobacteria—reached their peak diversity. During this time, the ancestors of fungi diverged from the ancestors of animals, marking an important evolutionary split within eukaryotes. By the Ediacaran Period (635–541 million years ago), the first complex, soft-bodied multicellular organisms had appeared, including members of the enigmatic Ediacaran biota, which represent some of the earliest known macroscopic life forms.</string>

    <string name="cambrian_physics">Mean temperature: 21 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 12.5%</string>
    <string name="cambrian_description">The Cambrian Period was the first geological period of the Paleozoic Era and marked a profound transformation in life on Earth. Before the Cambrian, most living organisms were microscopic and relatively simple. However, the Cambrian saw an unprecedented diversification of life in an event known as the Cambrian Explosion. During this time, many major animal phyla first appeared in the fossil record, and complex ecosystems emerged.\nThe great glaciers of the late Proterozoic Eon had long melted, leading to high sea levels that flooded vast areas of continents with warm, shallow seas—an ideal environment for marine life. The Earth was generally cool during the Early Cambrian, likely due to the supercontinent Gondwana covering the South Pole, which disrupted polar ocean currents. However, global temperatures were still around 7°C higher than today. While polar ice caps and glaciations may have existed, the climate gradually warmed toward the end of the period. Glaciers retreated, sea levels rose dramatically, and this warming trend continued into the Ordovician Period.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_additional_title">The Cambrian Explosion</string>
    <string name="cambrian_additional">The Cambrian Explosion was a relatively brief evolutionary event, during which approximately 63% of all biological classes and most of the major modern animal phyla first appeared. This period saw the emergence of complex ecosystems, with the development of burrowing behaviors and the widespread diversification of skeletonized animals, which were previously absent or rare.\nPossible causes of this evolutionary event:\n1. Increased atmospheric oxygen levels, which supported larger and more complex organisms.\n2. The formation of an ozone layer, reducing the harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and enabling life to thrive in shallower waters.\n3. The Snowball Earth events during the late Proterozoic, which led to mass extinctions and opened up ecological niches for new life forms.\n4. Higher calcium concentrations in Cambrian seawater, allowing marine organisms to develop skeletons, shells, and other hard body structures.\n5. Developmental changes, including the evolution of Hox genes, which played a key role in organizing body plans and enabling more complex organisms to form.\n6. Changes in the food web, leading to coevolution and predator-prey “arms races” that drove anatomical and behavioral innovations.\nThe Cambrian was also a time of evolutionary experimentation, resulting in many bizarre and unique body plans, some of which have no modern descendants.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_life_forms">Most animal life during the Cambrian was aquatic. Arthropods were by far the most dominant animals in the ocean, with trilobites being particularly abundant. This period also saw the emergence of many new mineralized organisms, as well as the first widespread burrowing animals, which played a key role in reshaping seafloor ecosystems. However, unlike in modern times, most animals lived on or near the sea floor, with very few swimming or pelagic species.</string>

    <string name="ordovician_physics">Mean temperature: 16 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 13.5%</string>
    <string name="ordovician_description">The Ordovician is the second of six periods of the Paleozoic Era. During this period, ancient oceans separated the largely barren continents of Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia, and the supercontinent Gondwana. The Ordovician saw a great diversification of marine life, including the rise of early corals, cephalopods, and the first jawless fish. However, the period ended with one of the most severe ice ages in Earth’s history, leading to the second-largest mass extinction, which wiped out around 85% of marine species. Ice sheets covered much of the southern region of Gondwana, dramatically altering global sea levels and climate.</string>
    <string name="ordovician_additional_title">Ordovician Radiation</string>
    <string name="ordovician_additional">The Ordovician period is notable for the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE), a time of rapid biological diversification that replaced the distinctive Cambrian fauna with a Paleozoic fauna rich in suspension feeders and pelagic animals. This event followed the Cambrian-Ordovician extinction, which was likely caused by a sudden glaciation and a depletion of available oxygen in the oceans.\nThe primary driver of the Ordovician radiation was a major shift in paleogeography. Due to high sea levels, continents became highly fragmented into distinct marine provinces, fostering regional biodiversity. Intense orogeny (mountain-building events), along with increased erosion, contributed to high ecosystem productivity by delivering abundant nutrients into the oceans.\nWhile the Cambrian Explosion was crucial in establishing most modern animal phyla, the GOBE can be seen as the event that diversified these phyla into modern classes and lower-level taxa, significantly shaping marine ecosystems that would persist for millions of years.</string>
    <string name="ordovician_life_forms">Life during the Ordovician continued to flourish, with an explosion of marine biodiversity, including the rise of the first coral reefs, trilobites, brachiopods, mollusks, and the first true vertebrates—jawless fish. However, the period ended with a catastrophic mass extinction at the boundary with the Silurian. This extinction was primarily driven by severe global cooling, glaciation, and associated sea-level changes. Despite this, the fauna that emerged and thrived during the Ordovician laid the foundation for marine ecosystems throughout the remainder of the Paleozoic Era.</string>

    <string name="silurian_physics">Mean temperature: 17 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 14%</string>
    <string name="silurian_description">The Silurian is a relatively short geological period, lasting approximately 24 to 28 million years. During this time, Laurentia collided with Baltica, closing the northern branch of the Iapetus Ocean and forming the "Old Red Sandstone" continent. Coral reefs thrived, becoming more widespread and diverse, and the first vascular land plants began to colonize the previously barren continents, marking a significant evolutionary step in the history of life on land.</string>
    <string name="silurian_additional_title">Terrestrial plant diversification</string>
    <string name="silurian_additional">The evolutionary appearance of vascular plants dramatically altered Earth\'s environment, paving the way for animal life on land and fundamentally changing Earth\'s atmosphere. Interestingly, plant evolution progressed much faster than animal evolution: during the Late Silurian, plants were structurally simple and small, but by the end of the Devonian (approximately 46 million years later), almost all present-day plant lineages (except flowering plants) had emerged.\nOne possible explanation is that adapting to terrestrial life posed a greater challenge for plants than for animals. At the level of the individual organism, all plants (except parasitic ones) must perform four essential functions to grow and survive:\n1. Intercept sunlight.\n2. Exchange atmospheric gases with the environment.\n3. Acquire, transport, and conserve water.\n4. Cope with external mechanical forces.\nThese tasks are interdependent and often conflict with one another. For example: a) Increasing surface area to capture more sunlight and facilitate gas exchange can reduce water conservation. b) Positioning leaves horizontally to maximize light interception increases mechanical stress.\nAquatic environments are relatively uniform and stable, while terrestrial environments are affected by wind, temperature changes, unpredictable precipitation, and varying sunlight. Adapting to diverse terrestrial conditions required innovative solutions for each of the basic functions, leading to significant diversification in plant body forms.\nAdditionally, greater exposure to ultraviolet light above the wate\'s surface likely caused more mutations, accelerating evolutionary changes. However, the theory of plant fitness—how well plants adapted to the challenges of terrestrial life—best explains the rapid evolution of land plants.</string>
    <string name="silurian_life_forms">Multicellular life began to appear on land in the form of small, bryophyte-like and early vascular plants that grew near lakes, streams, and coastlines. The Silurian period also marked the first appearance of arthropods on land, including primitive millipedes and arachnids. However, terrestrial life would not significantly diversify or impact the landscape until the Devonian period.\nA major evolutionary milestone during the Silurian was the diversification of bony fishes (Osteichthyes), which began to dominate marine ecosystems. This diversification laid the foundation for the evolution of many modern fish lineages.</string>

    <string name="devonian_physics">Mean temperature: 20 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 15%</string>
    <string name="devonian_description">The Devonian is the fourth of the six periods of the Paleozoic era. It was a relatively warm period, though occasionally disrupted by glaciations. The climate was generally arid, particularly near the equator. During this time, the Early Paleozoic oceans were gradually closing, leading to the formation of a “pre-Pangea” supercontinent. This continental configuration allowed fish to migrate from the southern hemisphere continents to North America and Europe. For the first time, extensive forests appeared in the equatorial regions of what is now Arctic Canada. The period concluded with the Late Devonian extinction, which resulted in the loss of about 50% of all genera, significantly impacting marine life, including many fish and reef-building organisms.</string>
    <string name="devonian_additional_title">The Late Devonian extinction</string>
    <string name="devonian_additional" formatted="false">The Late Devonian extinction was one of the five major extinction events in Earth\'s history. Rather than being a single event, it consisted of a series of two major crises known as the Kellwasser and Hangenberg events. It is estimated that around 75% of all animal species disappeared during this time. The extinction primarily affected marine life, severely impacting groups such as brachiopods, trilobites, and reef-building organisms, which almost completely collapsed. Major fish groups like Placodermi, Heterostraci, and Anaspida were completely wiped out. The extinction event destroyed approximately 97% of all vertebrate species, with only smaller forms surviving. In the aftermath, no sharks larger than a meter and almost no fishes or tetrapods larger than 10 centimeters remained, and it would take around 10 million years before they began to increase in size again. However, despite its catastrophic impact, the Late Devonian extinction crucially paved the way for the evolution of modern vertebrate fauna, including actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes), chondrichthyans (cartilaginous fishes), and tetrapods.\nThe crash in biodiversity during the Late Devonian was more drastic than the famous mass extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous.\nThe causes of this extinction event remain uncertain. Some proposed explanations include:\n1. An asteroid impact.\n2. Evolutionary changes in plants, particularly the development of root systems, which led to massive water eutrophication and subsequent anoxia.\n3. A reduction in atmospheric carbon dioxide, causing global cooling.\n4. Increased magmatism and volcanic activity.</string>
    <string name="devonian_life_forms">Free-sporing vascular plants began to spread across dry land during the Devonian period, covering the continents with extensive forests. By the Middle Devonian, several groups of plants had evolved leaves and true roots, marking significant advancements in plant evolution. Groups such as lycophytes, equisetophytes, and pteridophytes diversified, forming the first complex terrestrial ecosystems.\nFish achieved remarkable diversity during this time, earning the Devonian the nickname “Age of Fish”. Placoderms, armored prehistoric fish, were the most dominant group. The ancestors of tetrapods, particularly lobe-finned fish, began to adapt to walking on land, as their robust pectoral and pelvic fins gradually evolved into legs. These transitional species paved the way for the later evolution of amphibians.\nThe first ammonites (a group of molluscs) appeared, marking an important diversification of marine life. Trilobites and large coral reef systems remained common, with one notable now-dry barrier reef, located in what is now the Kimberley Basin of Northwest Australia, once extending approximately a thousand kilometers.</string>

    <string name="carboniferous_physics">Mean temperature: 14 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 32.5%</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_description">The name "Carboniferous" means “coal-bearing,” referring to the extensive coal deposits formed during this period. In the Early Carboniferous, the Paleozoic oceans between Euramerica and Gondwana began to close, giving rise to mountain ranges such as the Appalachians and the Variscans. A large ice cap developed over the South Pole, while lush, tropical coal swamps near the Equator supported the evolution of four-legged vertebrates (tetrapods) and the first winged insects.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_additional_title">Carboniferous collapse and coal</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_additional">The Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse was a significant ecological event that occurred around 305 million years ago. It disrupted the vast coal forests that once covered the equatorial region, fragmenting them into isolated patches. This fragmentation led to dwarfism and the eventual extinction of many plant and animal species.\nThe collapse resulted in the extinction of dominant lycopsid trees and a shift toward ecosystems dominated by more opportunistic plants like tree ferns. Before the event, animal species were distributed widely across the forests, but afterward, each isolated “island” of rainforest developed its own unique mix of species—this process is known as endemism.\nOxygen levels reached a record high of approximately 32.5% during the Carboniferous, allowing enormous arthropods like Meganeura (a giant dragonfly-like insect) and Arthropleura (a giant millipede-like arthropod) to thrive. However, following the rainforest collapse, oxygen levels declined, leading to the extinction of many of these giants. The increasingly arid climate also caused a mass decline in amphibian diversity, opening ecological space for reptiles to diversify—organisms better suited to dry environments.\nSeveral hypotheses have been proposed to explain the collapse, with the most widely accepted being climate aridification and increased volcanic activity.\nThis event also played a role in the formation of large coal deposits. During the Carboniferous, extensive swamp forests prevented the full decomposition of dead plant material. At the time, few animals or microbes had evolved enzymes to break down tough substances like phenolic lignin and waxy suberin. Fungi capable of decomposing these materials appeared only toward the end of the period, which is one reason why massive coal formation is largely limited to the Carboniferous.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_life_forms">The Carboniferous is renowned for its vast tropical rainforests dominated by towering plants like Lepidodendron, Sigillaria, and Calamites—some of the largest and most extensive forests in Earth’s history. Giant arthropods and insects thrived during this time, aided by high atmospheric oxygen levels and the absence of effective predators. Terrestrial vertebrates became increasingly abundant: amphibians diversified greatly, and following the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse, reptiles began to flourish due to their better adaptation to drier environments.</string>

    <string name="permian_physics">Mean temperature: 16 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 23%</string>
    <string name="permian_description">The Permian was the final period of the Paleozoic Era, it ended with the most extensive mass extinction in Earth’s history, wiping out approximately 90% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial species. During this time, most of the world\'s landmasses were joined into two large continents—Pangaea and Siberia—surrounded by a vast global ocean called Panthalassa. Western Pangaea was dominated by arid deserts, while reptiles, including early ancestors of mammals, diversified and spread widely across the supercontinent.</string>
    <string name="permian_additional_title">Great Dying</string>
    <string name="permian_additional" formatted="false">The Permian—and the entire Paleozoic Era—ended 252 million years ago with the most severe mass extinction in Earth’s history. The Permian-Triassic extinction event, also known as the Great Dying, wiped out about 95% of all marine species and 70% of all terrestrial species.\nMarine environments were hit particularly hard. Entire groups such as acanthodians (spiny sharks), sea scorpions, trilobites (already in decline), fusulinids, and Tabulata and Rugosa corals became completely extinct. Shelled marine animals were severely affected—96% of brachiopod species, 97% of ammonites, 59% of bivalves, and 98% of gastropods perished.\nTerrestrial ecosystems also suffered enormously. Most large tetrapods disappeared, and around 80% of insect species were lost. Paleozoic wet forests, once dominated by ancient plants like Sigillaria, Lepidodendron, and Gigantopteris, were devastated due to widespread aridification and intense wildfires.\nSeveral interlinked causes contributed to this catastrophe:\n1. Massive volcanic eruptions in the region now known as the Siberian Traps released enormous quantities of carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrogen sulfide. These gases drastically altered atmospheric chemistry. Methane reacted with atmospheric oxygen, reducing oxygen levels from 30% to around 13%. The ozone layer was damaged, exposing the surface to harmful ultraviolet radiation. This led to a rapid increase in global temperatures—by as much as 8°C.\n2. Oceans became dangerously deoxygenated. Warmer temperatures reduced oxygen absorption, and toxic gases led to acidification. Acidic water dissolved the calcium carbonate shells of mollusks and corals, leading to their mass extinction. The proliferation of cyanobacteria and microbial mats further consumed what little oxygen remained, turning the seas into anoxic, acidic, nearly lifeless zones.\n3. A temporary weakening of Earth's magnetic field may have allowed increased solar radiation to reach the surface, creating extreme seasonal swings with scorching summers followed by bitterly cold winters.\nThe devastation was so profound that ecosystems took over 30 million years to recover their former diversity—not until the Middle Triassic. The extinction selectively eliminated dominant Paleozoic life forms, erasing 79% of their families, while only 27% of the lineages that would come to thrive in the Mesozoic were affected.</string>
    <string name="permian_life_forms">The Permian began with Carboniferous-era plant life still thriving. In the Middle Permian, a major shift in vegetation occurred: swamp-loving lycopod trees such as Lepidodendron and Sigillaria were gradually replaced by more advanced seed ferns like Glossopteris, along with early conifers, ginkgoes, and cycads.\nInsects during this time were dominated by primitive relatives of cockroaches and early dragonflies. Early Permian terrestrial ecosystems were populated by pelycosaurs (sail-backed synapsids like Dimetrodon) and large amphibians. By the Middle Permian, these groups declined and were succeeded by primitive therapsids—mammal-like reptiles. In the Late Permian, more advanced therapsids such as gorgonopsians emerged, becoming top predators.\nToward the very end of the Permian, the first archosaurs appeared—a group that would later evolve into dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and crocodiles. Also emerging in this period were the earliest cynodonts, small therapsids that would eventually give rise to mammals in the Triassic.</string>

    <string name="triassic_physics">Mean temperature: 17 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 16%</string>
    <string name="triassic_description">The Triassic began in the wake of Permian-Triassic extinction event, which left the Earth’s biosphere impoverished.  Life did not recover until the middle of this period.\nThe supercontinent of Pangea, mostly assembled by the Triassic, allowed land animals to migrate from the South Pole to the North Pole, and warm-water faunas spread across the Tethys Sea.</string>
    <string name="triassic_additional_title">The Nocturnal Bottleneck</string>
    <string name="triassic_additional">The nocturnal bottleneck hypothesis explains several mammal traits. This hypothesis states that mammals were mainly – or even exclusively – nocturnal through most of their evolutionary story, starting their origin 225 million years ago, and only ending with the demise of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. While some mammal groups have later evolved to fill diurnal niches, the 160 million years spent as nocturnal animals has left a lasting legacy on basal anatomy and physiology, and most mammals are still nocturnal.\nMammals evolved from cynodonts, a group of superficially dog-like reptiles, in the wake of the Permian-Triassic mass extinction. The emerging archosaurian groups that flourished after the extinction, including crocodiles and dinosaurs, drove the larger cynodonts into extinction, leaving only smaller forms. The surviving cynodonts could only succeed in niches with minimal competition from the diurnal dinosaurs, evolving into the typical small-bodied insectivorous dwellers of the nocturnal undergrowth.\nDespite the massive extinction at the end of the Cretaceous, mammals continued to be small-bodied for millions of years. While all the largest animals alive today are mammals, the majority of mammals are still small and nocturnal.\nThis hypothesis also explains why mammals became warm blooded, because at night temperatures are cooler, and their early burrowing lifestyle required more thermo-isolation.</string>
    <string name="triassic_life_forms">The Permian-Triassic extinction devastated both terrestrial and marine life. Biodiversity rebounded in the Triassic, as the surviving species repopulated empty terrain, but these were short lived. At first, 90% of the big terrestrial vertebrates belonged to a single genus of therapsids – Lystrosaurus – a sure sign that ecosystems were badly damaged as biodiversity was low. Diverse communities with complex food-web structures took another 30 million years to re-establish themselves. By the Middle Triassic, big therapsids were replaced by archosaurs (the ancestors of dinosaurs, crocodiles, and birds), and the dinosaurs began to establish themselves.\nSeed plants began to displace spores to dominate the terrestrial flora: in the northern hemisphere conifers, ferns, and bennettitales; and in the southern hemisphere Glossopteris trees.\nAs with other periods, this period ended with a mass extinction, which wiped out conodonts, most of the marine reptiles and invertebrates, and some remaining large therapsids and amphibians.</string>

    <string name="jurassic_physics">Mean temperature: 16.5 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 26%</string>
    <string name="jurassic_description">The Jurassic is the second period of the Mesozoic era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The supercontinent of Pangea began to break apart in the Middle Jurassic. In the Late Jurassic the Central Atlantic Ocean was a narrow ocean separating Africa from North America. Eastern Gondwana had begun to separate from Western Gondwana.</string>
    <string name="jurassic_additional_title">Dinosaurian Prominence</string>
    <string name="jurassic_additional">About 20 million years after the Permian-Triassic extinction, dinosaurs diverged from their archosaurian ancestors and began to challenge the reigning archosauromorphs and therapsids. At first, they were not the dominant terrestrial animals, but after the Triassic-Jurassic extinction, which wiped out many of their competitors, they rose to prominence and occupied all the main niches for the next 135 million years.\nTwo main questions now are:\n1. How did some of the terrestrial dinosaurs become so massive? Most of the sauropods were huge – Argentinosaurus (weighing more than 100 tons), Mamenchisaurus, Diplodocus etc.\n2. Were dinosaurs feathered and warm blooded, or not?\nBoth of these questions are closely related, however there are still no clear answers.\nThe largest dinosaurs were herbivores, and a larger body is better protection against predators. In a crowded ecological space, herbivores may have evolved towards the only available unfilled niches – larger size – causing a “race to the top”, within the limits imposed by the physical environment and ecological capacity.\nThe largest sauropods grew incredibly fast – up to 5000 kg per year. Such growth rates require a very high metabolism, which is not usually observed in cold-blooded animals. However, a high metabolism (and warm blood) can become a disadvantage as body mass increases, as it requires more energy to heat – and to cool - larger volumes. Scientists now think that growing sauropods probably were warm-blooded, but their metabolism probably decreased as they approached their adult size.\nWe still have much to learn about dinosaurian physiology, but the traditional presentation of dinosaurs as cold blooded, lizard-like reptiles is giving way to a sense that most dinosaurs probably had some kind of thermoregulation. Recent dinosaur discoveries in North America provide evidence of at least seasonal dinosaurian presence in colder environments. And the latest discoveries of feathered velociraptors show that even large dinosaurs were feathered – likely even the notorious Tyrannosaurus Rex. The only dinosaurs that survived the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction – today’s birds – are feathered and warm blooded, so why not the larger Jurassic dinosaurs?</string>
    <string name="jurassic_life_forms">During the Jurassic period, the dominant marine vertebrates were fish and marine reptiles like ichthyosaurs (marine reptiles that resembled today’s dolphins), plesiosaurs (long-necked marine reptiles), pliosaurs (a version of the plesiosaur with a shorter neck and longer head), and crocodiles. Numerous turtles could be found in lakes and rivers.\nThe Jurassic was a golden age for the sauropods (large, long-necked herbivores like Diplodocus). During the Late Jurassic, the first avialans (bird-like dinosaurs), like Archaeopteryx, evolved.\nThe arid, continental conditions characteristic of the Triassic steadily eased during the Jurassic period. The warm, humid climate allowed lush jungles to cover much of the landscape. The conifers in particular dominated the flora.</string>

    <string name="cretaceous_description">The Cretaceous is the last period of the Mesozoic era, ending with a large mass extinction – the famous comet that destroyed the dinosaurs. It was a period with a relatively warm climate, resulting in high sea levels that created numerous shallow inland seas.\nDuring the Cretaceous the South Atlantic Ocean opened. India separated from Madagascar and raced northward on a collision course with Eurasia. Notice that North America was connected to Europe, and that Australia was still joined to Antarctica.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_additional_title">End of the Age of Dinosaurs</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_additional">The Cretaceous period ended with a massive extinction event, known as Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction. Numerous plant and animal species on Earth were wiped out, and all the non-avian dinosaurs became dead. With the exception of some cold-blooded species like turtles and crocodiles, no tetrapods weighing more than 25 kilograms survived. It marked the end of the Cretaceous period and with it, the entire Mesozoic Era, opening the Cenozoic Era that continues today.\nWhat could cause such a massive extinction? Now there are almost no disputes, that the cause of this event was a massive asteroid – 10-15 kilometers in diameter – falling near what is now Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. The consequences of this impact were of a planet-wide cataclysm. Dust blocked the sun for an entire year, preventing photosynthesis. Plant species died out, followed by the herbivores that fed on them and the carnivores that fed on the herbivores.  The asteroid also happened to strike a region of sulfur-rich carbonate rock, which caused higher ocean acidity.  As in the Great Dying, which ended the Paleozoic, the sharp increase in acidity wiped out many shelly marine animals, especially molluscs (like ammonites) and corals, and the animals that depended on them for food. The sea surface temperature dropped as much as 7 degrees Celsius for decades after the impact. It would take several hundred thousand years for Earth’s geochemistry to recover.\nThe sustained disruption killed all the reigning non-avian dinosaurs.  One interesting question is why the catastrophe did not wipe out the dinosaurs’ close relatives, the crocodilians. It is thought, that cold-blooded crocodiles have a much more limited need for food (they can survive months without eating) while warm-blooded animals of similar size need far more food (still more evidence that dinosaurs were likely warm-blooded, at least to some extent).\nThe elimination of the dominant Cretaceous groups allowed other organisms to take their place, spurring a remarkable series of adaptive radiations in Paleogene. The most striking example is the replacement of dinosaurs by mammals, who quickly diversified to fill the places left by the dinosaurs. In an important sense, therefore, the ultimate evolution of humans depended critically upon the extinction of the dinosaurs.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_life_forms">Flowering plants (angiosperms) appeared for the first time during the Cretaceous, however they did not become dominant until close to the end of the period. Their evolution was aided by the appearance of bees. In fact, angiosperms and insects are good examples of coevolution. The first representatives of many leafy trees, including figs, planes, and magnolias appeared in the Cretaceous.\nOn land, mammals were generally small in size, but an important component of the fauna. The apex predators were of course the archosaurian reptiles, especially dinosaurs, which were at their most diverse stage. Pterosaurs were common in the Early and Middle Cretaceous, but as the period proceeded, they declined (for reasons that are still poorly understood).\nInsects diversified during Cretaceous, with the appearance of ants, termites, butterflies and moths, aphids, grasshoppers, and gall wasps.\nIn the seas - rays, modern sharks, and bony fish became common. Marine reptiles included ichthyosaurs in the Early and Middle Cretaceous, with plesiosaurs and mosasaurs appearing before the end of the period.</string>

    <string name="paleogene_description">The Paleogene is the first period of the Cenozoic Era. This period consists of Paleocene, Eocene, and Oligocene epochs. The end of the Paleocene (about 55 million years ago) was marked by the Eocene Thermal Maximum, one of the most important periods of global change during the Cenozoic. The global climate during the Paleogene began a cooling and drying trend, periodically disrupted by warm periods. The trend was caused partially by the formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which significantly lowered oceanic water temperatures.\nDuring this time, India began to collide with Asia forming the Tibetan plateau and the Himalaya Mountains. Australia, which had been attached to Antarctica, began to move rapidly northward.</string>
    <string name="paleogene_additional_title">Eocene thermal maximum</string>
    <string name="paleogene_additional">The Eocene thermal maximum was a time period with 5-8 °C warmer global average temperature than today. This climate event began at the time boundary between the Paleocene and Eocene geological epochs around 55.5 million years ago.\nIt was propelled by two massive carbon injections, each lasting 1,500 years. The entire warm period lasted for about 200,000 years. The amount of carbon released during this time was more than 30 times larger than all the fossil fuels burned to date and equivalent to all the current fossil fuel reserves we have.\nThis event was probably caused by melting of seafloor methane ices (clathrates), or volcanism heating organic-rich rocks and releasing methane.\nThere was enhanced storminess in some areas (allusion to the modern storm regions of Caribbean and East Asia), increased aridity in tropical region and increased humidity closer to the poles. While there was significant ecological disruption, most species (except deep-sea foraminifera) were able to avoid extinction via adaptation or migration. First wave of modern mammals showed up, including ancestral primates, ungulates and cetaceans. Continent-scale migration of animals, and plants, ranges were shifted. Increased temperatures caused decrease in body size in mammalian species (dwarfism). There is a proposition, that under elevated carbon dioxide levels plants grow quickly, but are less nutritious than they normally would be. It might describe, why early horses experienced a body-size decrease of about 20-30%.\nThe rate at which carbon emissions warmed Earth’s climate resembles modern, human-caused global warming and can provide clues to the future of modern climate change.</string>
    <string name="paleogene_life_forms">Mammals began a rapid diversification during this period; some mammals evolved into large forms that would dominate on land, while others would adapt to marine life. Those that took to the oceans became modern cetaceans, while those that took to the trees became primates. Birds, which were already well established by the end of the Cretaceous, also experienced an adaptive radiation, as they took over skies free of the now-extinct pterosaurs. As the climate cooled, tropical plants became less numerous, and their range was restricted to equatorial regions.</string>

    <string name="neogene_physics">Mean temperature: 14 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 21.5%</string>
    <string name="neogene_description">The Neogene is a period that spans 20.45 million years. It is sub-divided into two epochs, the earlier Miocene and the later Pliocene. The Isthmus of Panama connected North and South America later in the Pliocene, cutting off the Atlantic Ocean from the warm ocean currents from the Pacific, and leaving only the Gulf Stream to transfer heat to the Arctic Ocean. The global climate cooled considerably over the course of the Neogene, culminating in a series of continental glaciations in the Quaternary period that follows.\n20 million years ago, Antarctica was covered by ice and the northern continents were cooling rapidly. The world has taken on a \"modern\" look, but notice that Florida and parts of Asia were under water.</string>
    <string name="neogene_additional_title">Cooler effect</string>
    <string name="neogene_additional">During the Neogene world became much drier and cooler, culminating disaster of the Pleistocene ice ages and the harsh conditions of our own day. During this interval, the relatively uniform and stable climatic regime which had cradled the world’s ecosystems for 200 million years, since the Late Triassic, came to a comparatively quick end. The drift of the continents had sealed off the waters of the far arctic, as the northern margins of Asia and North America crowded together. The closing of the Isthmus of Panama prevented warm currents from the Pacific to the Atlantic. In the south, Antarctica, now out of contact with any other landmass, was circled by a continuous circum-polar current. Perhaps for the first time since the Ordovician, both poles were thermally isolated from the warm equatorial waters and started accumulating heavy coverings of ice. The ice sheets, in turn reflected more sunlight and lowered sea levels, further reducing temperatures and warm-water circulation.\nThe world dried out, huge deserts developed in North Africa and Central Asia. The deep forests of the continental interiors were replaced by arid plains, steppe, prairie or tundra. Many herbivorous animal species died out or were forced to change together with their predators. By the end of the period, the world became similar to what we see now.</string>
    <string name="neogene_life_forms">During this period, mammals and birds continued to evolve into roughly modern forms, while other groups remained relatively unchanged. Early hominids, the ancestors of humans, appeared in Africa near the end of this period and later spread into Eurasia. Tropical plant species gave way to deciduous ones and grasslands replaced many forests. Grasses therefore greatly diversified, and herbivorous mammals evolved alongside it, creating the many grazing animals of today, such as horses and antelopes.</string>

    <string name="quaternary_physics">Mean temperature: 14 °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: 20.8%</string>
    <string name="quaternary_description">The Quaternary Period is the current and most recent of the three periods of the Cenozoic Era. It is divided into two epochs: the Pleistocene and the Holocene (which began 11,700 years ago). The Quaternary is typically defined by the cyclic growth and decay of continental ice sheets driven by Milankovitch cycles and the associated climate and environmental changes that occurred. The last expansion of the polar ice sheets took place about 12,000 years ago.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_additional_title">Ice Age</string>
    <string name="quaternary_additional">The Quaternary is a period of the repeating glaciations, which are defined by the previously mentioned Milankovitch cycles. The angle of Earth’s axial tilt with respect to the orbital plane varies between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees over a cycle of about 41,000 years. The current tilt is 23.44 degrees, roughly halfway between its extreme values. Increased tilt increases the amplitude of the seasonal cycle, providing more solar radiation in each hemisphere’s summer and less in winter – in other words, climate at higher latitudes becomes warmer and stops glaciation. The tilt last reached its maximum 10,700 years ago and now is in the decreasing phase of its cycle and will reach its minimum in 9,800 years. The current trend of decreasing tilt will promote milder seasons, as well as an overall cooling trend. A new Ice Age is approaching.\nIn order to understand the impact of the glaciations, we should compare three regions at roughly the same latitude – China, North America, and Europe. Chinese flora is extremely rich, with million-year-old relics like Ginkgo, Magnolia, and Thujopsis. North America, too, has such ancient plants as Taxodium and Sequoiadendron.  Europe, however, has essentially no ancient plant groups at all (except for a few in the Mediterranean). Why is it that the Ice Ages affected plants in China and North America so differently from those in Europe?  The answer lies in geography.  Glaciations affect European plant life more severely: during the last glaciation, most of Europe was buried under ice and it was very difficult for Europe’s plants to escape southwards, because they were blocked by the Alps and Mediterranean Sea, both of which extend generally from east to west. (The Mediterranean region was able to retain some ancient plants like Platanus and Olea). North America, especially it’s eastern coastal region, was usually free of snow, and its mountains run generally north-south, making it easier for plants to retreat southward, away from the encroaching glaciers. China, in contrast, was not covered by glaciers at all. It’s hard to imagine that before the Quaternary, Europe was home to gingkoes and beautiful Magnolias.\nQuaternary glaciations also obstructed humans from migrating into Europe, and repeatedly destroyed the populations that did settle there.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_life_forms">The Quaternary is the modern period, and it represents our current fauna and flora. However, periodic glaciations had a huge impact on the terrestrial biota, frequently destroying plant and animal species. After the last ice age, many large Pleistocene mammals such as saber-tooth cats, mammoths, and mastodons became extinct worldwide.</string>

    <string name="future_physics">Mean temperature: x °C\nAtmospheric oxygen: y%</string>
    <string name="future_description">It is very hard to predict the future; however, we as an intelligent life forms can try to contemplate it. \nEarth will vanish eventually, because the Sun has its lifetime and will swallow our planet (unless our future siblings will be able to transfer Earth somewhere else). It is thought, that Earth’s habitable-zone lifespan is as long as 7.79 billion years. Because we already spent 4.56 billion years, we got around 3.23 billion years left, or even less – 1.75 billion years due to some scientists. It will get progressively hotter and there is nothing we can do about it. Sun converts hydrogen into helium and when the significant portion of it will be converted – it will undergo an internal change and become a Red Giant. This is how it is.\nBut it is an ideal case.</string>
    <string name="future_additional_title">Anthropogenic Future</string>
    <string name="future_additional" formatted="false">Life already showed it’s persistence and will to exist, so it will flourish with humans or without them. The current trends and risen concern in society about the ecology bring some optimism, because about 20 years ago people still believed EXXON lying about the non existent climate change and no one was thinking about the pollution etc. However, changes will occur anyway despite our wishes.\nThere is a hidden bomb in our understanding of the economy. Usually if country shows an economic growth of below the 3% it is portrayed as a slow growing one. But what does it mean to grow 3% per year? It basically means, that every 20 years economy doubles and current economy trends show, that with economic growth, energy consumption grows too. Since the industrial revolution we increased our energy consumption rates dramatically and we still use carbon-rich fossil fuel everywhere. Renewable energy still occupies just a tiny part of our produced energy.\nThe main law in physics states, that energy always emits heat – by the current calculations in 400 years we will need as much energy as the Sun provides and we will basically boil our oceans, if energy will be used as inefficiently as it is used today. And in 2000 years we will need energy of all the Milky Way galaxy stars. Now imagine Milky Way and its minimum diameter of 100,000 light years and ask yourself – is it possible to retain such consumption tempo?\nIt is more likely, that humanity will discover way more efficient energy sources and will adapt to live on Earth, because now humanity is trying to adapt Earth for life with people.\nAt the moment something similar to the Permian-Triassic extinction is happening now, but in faster rates. We dump tons of the carbon dioxide, Earth started to heat and already melts its polar caps, which contain massive amounts of trapped methane inside. Oceanic acidity had already risen during the recent years and it caused the partial death of the worldwide coral reefs, and anoxia is already spreading. Forests, which should fixate all the carbon dioxide are being cut for economic purposes. The sea levels will continue to rise. Such places like Florida, East Asia already suffer from the mass floods.\nCurrent events are driving Earth’s life towards the next mass extinction, however at least now it gather much more publicity and required attention.</string>

    <string name="archean_banded_iron_formation_description">Banded iron formations (BIFs) are distinctive sedimentary rock units composed of alternating layers of iron-rich minerals and iron-poor silica-rich bands, typically red due to hematite. These formations provide critical evidence of early biological and geochemical processes.\nThe prevailing hypothesis suggests that BIFs formed in ancient oceans as a result of oxygen released by photosynthetic cyanobacteria. Their presence in the Early Archean suggests that life may have existed as early as 3.85 billion years ago.\nDuring this period, Earth\'s oceans contained vast amounts of dissolved iron. As photosynthetic organisms produced oxygen, the iron reacted with it, precipitating as iron oxides and accumulating in these layered deposits. BIFs are rare in younger geological periods because most of the dissolved iron in the oceans was eventually removed, marking the Great Oxidation Event around 2.4 billion years ago.</string>
    <string name="archean_stromatolites_description">Stromatolites are layered, accretionary structures formed in shallow water through the trapping, binding, and cementation of sedimentary grains by microbial mats, primarily composed of cyanobacteria.\Fossilized stromatolites provide some of the oldest direct evidence of life on Earth, with examples dating back over 3.45 billion years. They exhibit a variety of forms and structures, ranging from columnar to domal shapes. While stromatolites are typically associated with biological activity, some possess features consistent with abiotic precipitation, making their origin a subject of ongoing study.\nStromatolites reached their peak diversity around 1.25 billion years ago, after which they declined in abundance and morphological variety, likely due to the rise of grazing organisms. Today, modern stromatolites are rare and primarily found in extreme environments such as hypersaline lakes and marine lagoons, where high salinity deters most grazing animals.</string>
    <string name="archean_primaevifilum_amoenum_description">Primaevifilum amoenum is one of the oldest known bacteria, with fossilized remains discovered in Western Australia. It was a filamentous microorganism that primarily lived in individual clasts, though it may have been part of a loosely organized benthic microbial community embedded in mucilage.\nUnlike many early microbial fossils, its microfossils have not been detected in stromatolite-like laminated clasts, suggesting a different ecological niche. These findings contribute to our understanding of early microbial diversity and the environmental conditions of the Archean Earth.</string>
    <string name="archean_acritarcha_description">Acritarchs are small, organic-walled microfossils that are resistant to acid dissolution and remain taxonomically unclassified. They represent a diverse group of structures, including the resting cysts of various green algae and possibly other microorganisms. Some acritarchs may also be linked to the reproductive or protective stages of unknown ancient eukaryotic life forms.\nDue to their resilience and abundance in the fossil record, acritarchs serve as valuable biostratigraphic markers, helping scientists understand the evolution of early life and past environmental conditions.</string>

    <string name="proterozoic_bangiomorpha_pubescens_description">Bangiomorpha pubescens is the earliest known sexually reproducing organism, dating to approximately 1.2 billion years ago. It belongs to the red algae (Rhodophyta) and is considered one of the first complex multicellular eukaryotes. The emergence of sexual reproduction was a pivotal moment in evolutionary history, not only because of the benefits of genetic recombination but also because it enabled the development of complex multicellularity. This evolutionary breakthrough laid the foundation for the diversification of eukaryotic life, making Bangiomorpha a crucial organism in the history of life on Earth.</string>
    <string name="proterozoic_nemiana_simplex_description">Nemiana simplex is one of the simplest sessile organisms of the Ediacaran biota, resembling a cnidarian-like jellyfish or a basal, soft-bodied polyp. It consists of a jelly-like sac that likely housed internal structures, though its anatomy remains poorly understood. Some hypotheses suggest it may have possessed small tentacle-like structures.\nIt is possible that this organism was entirely immobile, adhering to the seafloor, and fed through passive suspension feeding or direct absorption of dissolved nutrients from the water, possibly relying on microbial or algal matter for sustenance.</string>
    <string name="proterozoic_tribrachidium_heraldicum_description">Tribrachidium heraldicum was a tri-radially symmetrical organism that lived during the Late Ediacaran Period of the Proterozoic Eon, approximately 555 million years ago. It was a soft-bodied, benthic organism that likely rested on or was temporarily attached to the seafloor.\nUnlike most modern animals, Tribrachidium does not fit into any known major animal group, and its exact classification remains uncertain. It likely fed using a unique form of suspension feeding, generating microcurrents to capture organic particles suspended in the water.</string>
    <string name="proterozoic_dickinsonia_description">Dickinsonia is one of the earliest known organisms exhibiting bilateral symmetry, a body plan that later became dominant among modern animals. Its growth was likely indeterminate, as fossil specimens range from a few millimeters to approximately 1.4 meters in length. Evidence suggests that Dickinsonia grew continuously until it was buried by ocean sediments or otherwise perished.\nUnlike true bilaterians, Dickinsonia lacked a rigid body structure and may have absorbed nutrients directly from microbial mats on the seafloor. It spent most, if not all, of its life with its body in close contact with the sediment, possibly anchoring itself partially to the substrate.</string>
    <string name="proterozoic_cloudina_description">Cloudinids are among the earliest known animals with mineralized skeletons, dating to the late Ediacaran Period, approximately 550–541 million years ago. Their fossils consist of millimeter-scale calcareous cones nested within one another, forming tube-like structures. The emergence of mineralized skeletons may indicate the evolution of more complex ecological interactions by the end of the Proterozoic Eon.\nUntil this time, most organisms were benthic filter feeders, but fossil evidence from the late Proterozoic suggests the first appearance of predators. The presence of boreholes in Cloudina fossils provides some of the earliest direct evidence of predation, marking a significant shift in the evolution of marine ecosystems.</string>
    <string name="proterozoic_charnia_description">Charnia is a highly significant fossil, as it was the first Precambrian organism to be formally described from undoubted Precambrian rocks. It is also thought to be among the earliest known animals capable of sexual reproduction. Although its frond-like appearance resembles that of a fern, Charnia was neither a plant nor an algae, as it lived in deep-water environments well below the photic zone, where photosynthesis is impossible.\nInstead, it is believed to have absorbed nutrients directly from the surrounding water, possibly through osmotrophy, a feeding strategy common among some modern marine organisms.</string>

It is likely related to modern priapulid worms, which also exhibit similar burrowing behaviors.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_conodonta_description">Conodonta were ancient, eel-like, jawless vertebrates whose fossilized elements serve as crucial index fossils for stratigraphic correlation. Although these tooth-like elements appear formidable, the animals themselves were likely not active predators, possibly due to the lateral placement of their eyes. Estimates suggest that conodonts ranged in body length from 1 to 40 cm, highlighting the diversity among these early chordates.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_archaeocyatha_description">Archaeocyatha were the first large skeletal animals and the earliest known reef builders of the Cambrian, thriving in warm tropical and subtropical waters. Some archaeocyaths lived as solitary organisms, while others formed colonies, contributing to the structure of early marine ecosystems.\nThey resembled hollow horn corals, with porous, cup-shaped skeletons composed of calcite, which allowed water to circulate through their bodies for filter feeding.\nAround 516 million years ago, archaeocyaths experienced a sharp decline, coinciding with the rapid diversification of demosponges, which may have competed for ecological niches.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_trilobita_description">Trilobites represent one of the earliest known groups of arthropods and are iconic examples of Cambrian marine life. They flourished throughout the Paleozoic Era but experienced a significant decline during the Devonian before going extinct at the end of the Permian.\nTrilobites were among the most successful early animals, thriving in the oceans for over 270 million years. They exhibited a wide range of lifestyles—some crawled along the seafloor as predators, scavengers, or filter feeders, while others swam through the water column, feeding on plankton.\nIf you ever visit Morocco, you will likely encounter many merchants selling trilobite fossils, as the Anti-Atlas Mountains are composed of Paleozoic rocks rich in these ancient arthropods.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_wiwaxia_description">Wiwaxia is a genus of soft-bodied, bottom-dwelling animals covered in rows of carbonaceous scales and long, sharp spines. These dorsal spines may have served as a defense mechanism against predators. Wiwaxia likely moved by contracting a slug-like foot on its underside, similar to modern mollusks.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_myllokunmingia_description">Myllokunmingia is a genus of basal chordates, measuring approximately 28 mm in length and 6 mm in height. It is one of the oldest known possible craniates, possessing a skull and skeletal structures made of cartilage. Its anatomy suggests it was an early step in vertebrate evolution, sharing characteristics with modern jawless fish.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_pikaia_description">Pikaia is one of the oldest known relatives of vertebrates, exhibiting a worm-like body and likely swimming in an eel-like manner. Fossils reveal key chordate features, including an elongated notochord, a dorsal nerve cord, and segmented myotomes—critical characteristics in the early evolution of vertebrates.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_anomalocaris_description">Anomalocaris was a marine predator closely related to ancestral arthropods. It was one of the largest animals of the Cambrian oceans, reaching up to a meter in length. It possessed highly sophisticated stalked eyes, each with at least 16,000 lenses, providing vision as acute as that of modern insects. Its circular mouth was lined with a ring of hardened plates, adapted for grasping and consuming prey.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_opabinia_description">Opabinia was a soft-bodied marine animal of modest size, measuring between 4 and 7 cm in length. Its segmented body featured lateral lobes for swimming and a fan-shaped tail for propulsion. The head had highly unusual characteristics, including five eyes, a downward-facing mouth positioned beneath the head, and a flexible proboscis likely used to grasp and transfer food to the mouth.\nOpabinia likely lived on the seafloor, using its proboscis to search for and capture small, soft-bodied prey.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_marrella_description">Marrella was a small arthropod from the Middle Cambrian, measuring up to 2 cm in length. It scavenged organic debris along the seafloor. Marrella is considered a stem-group arthropod, meaning it shares a common ancestor with most or all later major arthropod groups but does not belong to any modern lineage.\nDespite its superficial resemblance to trilobites, Marrella is not more closely related to them than to other arthropods.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_foraminifera_description">Foraminifera are a group of amoeboid protists characterized by a streaming granular ectoplasm, which they use for capturing food and interacting with their environment. They are commonly encased in an external shell, or test, composed of various materials and exhibiting diverse forms. Most foraminifera are marine, with only a few species known from freshwater habitats.\nTheir shells are typically made of calcium carbonate and are usually less than 1 mm in size, though some species can grow up to 20 cm. Foraminifera are widely used as index fossils, particularly for dating rock layers from the Permian, Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Cenozoic periods.</string>
    <string name="cambrian_hallucigenia_description">Hallucigenia is thought to be an early relative of modern velvet worms (onychophorans), though some researchers suggest a closer relationship to arthropods. Its quirky name reflects its unusual appearance and the eccentric history of its study. This small, tubular organism measured between 0.5 and 3.5 cm in length and had seven or eight pairs of slender legs, each ending in a pair of claws. Additionally, it possessed spiny dorsal projections, likely serving as a defense against predators.</string>

These ancient marine animals lived during the Ordovician period and were among the earliest cephalopods. Based on their anatomy and the behavior of their modern relatives—squid, octopuses, cuttlefish, and the nautilus—it is likely that Orthoceras was a predator in the Paleozoic seas, hunting smaller marine creatures such as trilobites. Their streamlined shells allowed them to move through the water using jet propulsion, similar to modern cephalopods.</string>
    <string name="ordovician_pentecopterus_description">Pentecopterus decorahensis is the oldest known eurypterid, or "sea scorpion," dating back to the early Ordovician period. It could reach lengths of up to 1.83 meters, making it not only the earliest but also one of the largest arthropods ever discovered.\nSea scorpions were formidable marine predators that dominated coastal environments for millions of years, until their extinction during the Permian mass extinction event. They are closely related to modern horseshoe crabs—an ancient group of arthropods that still exists today.</string>
    <string name="ordovician_sacabambaspis_description">Sacabambaspis is a jawless fish and one of the earliest known vertebrates to possess skeletal tissues similar to those of modern vertebrates. It lived during the Ordovician period and had a distinctive armored head shield. Sacabambaspis also featured a primitive lateral line system—an early sensory structure still found in modern fish—that allowed it to detect vibrations and movement in the water.</string>
    <string name="ordovician_astraspis_description">Astraspis is one of the oldest known armored jawless fish, dating back to the Ordovician period. Its body was protected by large bony plates on the head and smaller, scale-like plates covering the rest of the body. It also had a mobile, flexible tail that aided in swimming, covered with small protective plate-like scales. Astraspis is significant in early vertebrate evolution as it shows the development of dermal armor, a key adaptation for defense in prehistoric seas.</string>
    <string name="ordovician_rugosa_description">Rugosa is an extinct order of corals that lived from the Middle Ordovician to the Late Permian. They existed in both solitary and colonial forms. Solitary individuals are commonly called horn corals due to their distinctive horn-shaped skeletons. Their hard skeletons were composed of calcite, which contributed to fossil preservation. Rugose corals played an important role in reef ecosystems before going extinct during the Permian mass extinction, also known as the Great Dying.</string>
    <string name="ordovician_tabulata_description">Tabulata is an extinct order of colonial corals that lived from the Early Ordovician to the end of the Permian period, coexisting with Rugosa. Their tightly packed, tube-like coral structures gave them a honeycomb-like appearance. Like Rugosa, their skeletons were composed of calcite, which helped preserve them as fossils. Tabulate corals were major reef builders in Paleozoic seas and played an important role in forming ancient marine ecosystems. They went extinct during the Permian mass extinction, the most severe extinction event in Earth\'s history.</string>

    <string name="silurian_eurypterus_description">Eurypterus is an extinct genus of sea scorpions (eurypterids), and its fossils are among the most commonly found within this group. These ancient arthropods were both predators and scavengers, capable of growing up to 1.3 meters in length. While primarily aquatic, they possessed the ability to breathe air and walk on land for brief periods, possibly to move between water bodies or escape unfavorable conditions.</string>
    <string name="silurian_pneumodesmus_description">Pneumodesmus is the earliest known myriapod and the oldest documented creature to have lived on land. It is also the first arthropod discovered with a tracheal system, making it the earliest known oxygen-breathing animal on land. Its fossil, found in Scotland, dates back to approximately 428 million years ago, providing significant insights into the early colonization of terrestrial environments.</string>
    <string name="silurian_cooksonia_description">Cooksonia is an extinct group of primitive land plants, representing some of the earliest vascular plants. They include the oldest known plant to possess a stem with vascular tissue, which allowed efficient water and nutrient transport. Cooksonia lacked leaves, flowers, and roots, and they were typically small, standing only a few centimeters tall. Each branch terminated in a sporangium, a spore-bearing capsule, which played a crucial role in their reproduction.</string>
    <string name="silurian_baragwanathia_description">Baragwanathia is a genus of extinct Lycopodiophyta plants, considered one of the earliest known vascular plants. They had unbranched, strap-shaped microphylls (small, simple leaves), and their stems contained an actinostele, a primitive type of vascular bundle arranged in a star-like pattern. These features indicate that Baragwanathia was an early representative of clubmoss-like plants, which would later diversify significantly.</string>
    <string name="silurian_acanthodii_description">Acanthodians, sometimes called spiny sharks, are an extinct group of fish that shared characteristics with both bony (Osteichthyes) and cartilaginous fish (Chondrichthyes). Despite their common name, they are not true sharks but represent several independent phylogenetic branches of early jawed fish. Acanthodians are considered ancestors to modern cartilaginous fish, such as sharks and chimaeras, and are significant for being among the first vertebrates to develop jaws, a major evolutionary advancement.</string>
    <string name="silurian_entelognathus_description">Entelognathus is an ancient placoderm fish and represents one of the earliest known jawed vertebrates. It is the first fish to possess dermal marginal jaw bones, including the premaxilla, maxilla, and dentary, which are typically found in modern bony fish. This discovery provides important evidence of the evolutionary transition from armored jawless fish to jawed vertebrates.</string>

    <string name="devonian_prototaxites_description">Prototaxites is a genus of ancient organisms that formed large trunk-like structures, up to 1 meter wide and reaching heights of up to 8 meters. Although it first appeared in the Late Silurian period, it reached its greatest diversity during the Devonian. Initially believed to be a giant fungus, recent discoveries indicate the presence of algal symbionts, suggesting that Prototaxites was more likely a lichen rather than a fungus in the strict sense.\nPrototaxites became extinct as shrubs and vascular trees rose to dominance, gradually replacing these massive structures in terrestrial ecosystems.</string>
    <string name="devonian_wattieza_description">Wattieza is a genus of prehistoric trees, considered to be the oldest known trees on Earth. They existed during the Middle Devonian period and were closely related to modern ferns and horsetails. Wattieza trees could grow up to 8 meters or more in height and reproduced by releasing spores, much like their modern relatives.</string>
    <string name="devonian_archaeopteris_description">Archaeopteris is an extinct genus of tree-like plants characterized by fern-like leaves. These plants could grow up to 10 meters in height, with trunks exceeding 1.5 meters in diameter. Archaeopteris thrived in wet soils, typically growing near river systems and within floodplain woodlands. It is considered a distant ancestor of modern gymnosperm plants, such as conifers, and played a significant role in forming some of the earliest forest ecosystems on Earth.</string>
    <string name="devonian_tiktaalik_description">Although it resembles an amphibian, Tiktaalik is a lobe-finned fish from the Late Devonian period, possessing many features similar to those of tetrapods. Tiktaalik is considered a key representative of the evolutionary transition from fish to amphibians. It exemplifies one of several ancient sarcopterygian fish lineages that developed adaptations for surviving in oxygen-poor, shallow-water habitats—environmental conditions that are believed to have driven the evolution of tetrapods.\nIt is thought that Tiktaalik was specialized for living in swampy, pond-like environments and may have occasionally used its uniquely adapted fins to move short distances over land.</string>
    <string name="devonian_ichthyostega_description">Ichthyostega is one of the earliest known tetrapods in the fossil record, living at the end of the Devonian period. It possessed lungs and limbs, adaptations that allowed it to navigate through shallow swamp waters. Although it resembles an amphibian, Ichthyostega is considered a stem group tetrapod and one of the closest known ancestors of modern amphibians. It had a fish-like tail and gills, but also possessed an amphibian-like skull and robust limbs, reflecting its transitional status between aquatic and terrestrial life.</string>
    <string name="devonian_bothriolepis_description">Bothriolepis is a widespread, abundant, and diverse genus of placoderms that thrived during the Middle to Late Devonian period. The largest species could reach about 1 meter in length. Bothriolepis was a bottom-dwelling, armored fish that primarily fed on detritus, algae, and small microorganisms, using its specialized mouthparts to sift through sediment.</string>
    <string name="devonian_cladoselache_description">Cladoselache is one of the earliest known shark groups, dating back to the Late Devonian period. These ancient sharks could grow up to 1.8 meters in length. They were fast and agile predators, characterized by having 5 to 7 gill slits and a short, rounded mouth. Unlike modern sharks, Cladoselache lacked scales and had a streamlined body, allowing for swift movement in the water.</string>
    <string name="devonian_dunkleosteus_description">Dunkleosteus is an extinct genus of placoderm fish that existed during the Late Devonian period. The largest species could grow up to 6 meters in length and weigh up to 1 tonne. As a hypercarnivorous apex predator, Dunkleosteus was known for its incredibly strong bite, capable of crushing hard-shelled prey such as ammonites and other armored fish.\nDue to its heavily armored exterior, Dunkleosteus was likely a relatively slow but powerful swimmer. Its massive, bony head shield provided both protection and a powerful leverage system for its jaw, compensating for its lack of true teeth with sharp bony plates.</string>
    <string name="devonian_acanthostega_description">Acanthostega is an extinct genus of stem-tetrapods and is among the earliest vertebrate animals to have recognizable limbs. It represents an anatomically intermediate form between lobe-finned fishes and fully terrestrial tetrapods. Acanthostega could grow up to 60 cm in length and had eight digits on each hand, linked by webbing.\nDespite having limbs, Acanthostega was primarily an aquatic animal, likely inhabiting shallow, weed-choked swamps. Its limbs were not well adapted for walking on land, indicating that it was still more suited for life in water.</string>
    <string name="devonian_materpiscis_description">Materpiscis is a genus of placoderm fish that lived near what is now Western Australia. Known from only one specimen, it is unique for containing an unborn embryo preserved inside the mother, along with a mineralized placental feeding structure. This remarkable find makes Materpiscis the oldest known vertebrate to exhibit viviparity, or giving birth to live young.\nMaterpiscis is represented by a single species, Materpiscis attenboroughi, named in honor of Sir David Attenborough, who first highlighted the significance of the Gogo fish sites in his 1979 documentary series "Life on Earth."</string>

    <string name="carboniferous_lepidodendron_description">Lepidodendron was an extinct, tree-like lycopsid and a dominant component of the Carboniferous coal forest flora. These plants could grow over 30 meters tall, with trunks exceeding 1 meter in diameter. They are believed to have grown rapidly and lived for only 10–15 years. Most species were likely monocarpic, meaning they reproduced just once near the end of their life cycle. By the Mesozoic era, Lepidodendron and its relatives had largely disappeared, likely outcompeted by emerging woody gymnosperms such as conifers, which were better adapted to changing climates and soil conditions.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_sigillaria_description">Sigillaria was an extinct, tree-like lycopsid closely related to Lepidodendron. It could grow up to 30 meters tall and had a relatively short life cycle, characterized by rapid growth and reaching maturity within just a few years. Sigillaria was a prominent member of the Carboniferous coal forests, with its distinctive vertical leaf scars forming a pattern that gives the plant its name.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_calamites_description">Calamites was an extinct, tree-like horsetail and a major component of the Carboniferous coal swamps. It could grow up to 30 meters tall and had a hollow, jointed stem structure similar to modern horsetails, but on a much larger scale. Calamites often grew in dense stands along rivers and floodplains, contributing significantly to the formation of coal deposits.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_akmonistion_description">Akmonistion was a shark-like chimaera that lived during the Early Carboniferous. Males had a distinctive anvil-shaped crest instead of a dorsal fin, with barbs on top and a triangular patch of spines located in front of the crest on the head. Females likely resembled the males but may have lacked both the crest and the patch of spines. Akmonistion is sometimes informally called the “ironing board shark” due to the unusual shape of its crest.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_helicoprion_description">Helicoprion was a long-lived genus of shark-like fish known for its unusual spiral arrangement of teeth, often called a "tooth whorl." These teeth were positioned in the lower jaw and may have been used for slicing soft-bodied prey. Helicoprion could reach lengths of 3–4 meters, with some large specimens estimated to grow up to 7.5 meters. Although it resembled a shark, it was more closely related to chimaeras.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_pederpes_description">Pederpes is the earliest known tetrapod to show clear adaptations for walking on land. Although not classified as an amphibian, it represents a very basal (primitive) member of the tetrapod lineage. Pederpes measured about 1 meter in length and displayed features well suited for terrestrial life, such as forward-facing feet for more effective movement on land. It is currently considered the earliest known fully terrestrial vertebrate.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_pterogyrinus_description">Proterogyrinus was a reptile-like amphibian and one of the early tetrapods that likely shares ancestry with the first reptiles. It could venture farther from water than most contemporary amphibians and was a top predator in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Proterogyrinus had strong limbs and a flexible body, allowing it to move efficiently on land while still being an effective swimmer.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_hylonomus_description">Hylonomus is the earliest known unquestionable reptile. It measured about 20 centimeters in length and resembled modern lizards in appearance. With its small, sharp teeth, it likely fed on small invertebrates such as millipedes and early insects. Fossils of Hylonomus have been found inside fossilized tree stumps, suggesting it may have used them for shelter or hunting.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_archaeothyris_description">Archaeothyris is the oldest known synapsid—the group of vertebrates that includes modern mammals and their extinct relatives. It resembled a modern-day lizard in appearance, but at around 50 centimeters long, it was one of the largest carnivores in the Carboniferous forests. Archaeothyris had sharp teeth and strong jaws, allowing it to prey on smaller vertebrates and insects.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_pulmonoscorpius_description">Pulmonoscorpius was a giant species of extinct scorpion that could grow up to 70 centimeters long. While its exact diet is not known, it likely preyed on smaller arthropods, and its powerful sting may have been capable of killing small early tetrapods. Pulmonoscorpius lived in the humid coal forests of the Carboniferous and is one of the largest scorpions known from the fossil record.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_arthropleura_description">Arthropleura was one of the largest known land invertebrates of all time and had few, if any, natural predators. It could grow up to 2.3 meters in length and about 50 centimeters in width. Like other Carboniferous arthropods, Arthropleura was able to grow so large due to the higher partial pressure of oxygen in Earth\'s atmosphere and the absence of large terrestrial vertebrate predators. This helps explain why similarly sized arthropods did not exist during later periods like the Cretaceous, despite similar oxygen levels.\nContrary to earlier and popular beliefs, Arthropleura was not a predator but an herbivorous arthropod, likely feeding on decaying plant material on the forest floor.</string>
    <string name="carboniferous_meganeura_description">Meganeura was an extinct genus of giant dragonfly-like insects, with a wingspan reaching up to 65 centimeters. Like Arthropleura, they were able to grow so large due to the higher atmospheric oxygen levels and the absence of large aerial predators during the Carboniferous period. Meganeura is one of the largest known flying insects in Earth’s history.</string>

    <string name="permian_glossopteris_description">Glossopteris is the largest and best-known genus of seed ferns which grew in the Southern Hemisphere during the Permian period. It was a woody, seed-bearing shrub or tree, some apparently reaching 30 meters tall. They have grown in a very wet soil conditions and outcompeted lycopsids such as Sigillaria and Lepidodendron during the Permian.</string>
    <string name="permian_dimetrodon_description">Dimetrodon is an extinct synapsid, mammal-like reptile. It could reach 4.6 metres in length and could have weighted up to 250 kilograms. It was probably one of the apex predators, feeding on fish and tetrapods. The sail of Dimetrodon may have been used to stabilize its spine and to heat and cool its body as a form of the thermoregulation.</string>
    <string name="permian_titanophoneus_description">Titanophoneus or in other words – “titanic murderer” is a carnivorous dinocephalian therapsid from the Middle Permian. The adult skull could reach 80 cm, it also had a heavy long snout and its total body length was about 2.9 meters.</string>
    <string name="permian_estemmenosuchus_description">Estemmenosuchus (meaning “crowned crocodile” in Greek) was a large omnivorous therapsid. It lived during the Middle Permian and could grow up to 3 meters long.</string>
    <string name="permian_gorgonops_description">Gorgonops were the dominant predators of their day and lived during the Late Permian. They could grow up to 3 meters long. They had two enlarged canine teeth, which could grow up to 12 cm in length.</string>
    <string name="permian_cynodontia_description">The cynodonts (“dog teeth”) are therapsids that first appeared in the Late Permian. This group includes modern mammals (including humans) as well as their extinct ancestors and close relatives. Non-mammalian cynodonts spread throughout Southern Gondwana and had many mammalian skeletal features. All cynodonts probably laid eggs (like the modern day platypus) and had some form of the warm-blooded metabolism, because many of them had fur.</string>

Although similar, they are more closely related to the modern cycads, ginkgo and conifers than angiosperms. However, this clade is polyphyletic, so there is a possibility, that some Bennettitales form a clade with Angiosperms.</string>
    <string name="triassic_morganucodon_description">Morganucodon was an early mammaliaform cynodont that lived during the Late Triassic. It was a small nocturnal animal with a body length reaching up to 10 cm – an example specimen of the nocturnal bottleneck effect.</string>
    <string name="triassic_lystrosaurus_description">Lystrosaurus was a herbivorous genus of Late Permian and Early Triassic therapsids, which size was similar to the pig. At least one Lystrosaurus specie survived the Permian-Triassic mass extinction and in the absence of predators and herbivorous competitors it became the most common terrestrial vertebrate during the Early Triassic. At one time, almost 90% of the land vertebrates belonged to this genus!</string>
    <string name="triassic_pterosauria_description">Pterosaurs were flying reptiles, which lived since the Late Triassic until the end of the Cretaceous. They were the earliest vertebrates to have evolved powered flight. Pterosauria were not “flying dinosaurs”, they actually do not belong to the Dinosauria clade.</string>
    <string name="triassic_plesiosauria_description">Plesiosauria was a group of marine reptiles, which lived throughout Mesozoic era. They had a flat body and a short tail. They breathed atmospheric air and bore live young; there are indicators that they were warm-blooded.</string>

    <string name="jurassic_allosaurus_description">Allosaurus was a large bipedal predator, which could grow up to 8.5 m in length and was at the top of the food chain. Their potential prey included ornithopods, stegosaurids, and sauropods. Some paleontologists interpret Allosaurus as having had cooperative social behavior, and hunting in packs, while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other, and that congregations of this genus are the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses. It may have attacked large prey by ambush, using its upper jaw like a hatchet.</string>
    <string name="jurassic_mamenchisaurus_description">Mamenchisaurus was a sauropod dinosaur genus, which included several species known for their remarkably long necks which made up half of their total body length.

The most complete specimen measures up to 12.3 meters in length and up to 3.7 meters in height.\nWhile there is no direct evidence for Tyrannosaurus having feathers, many scientists now consider that it likely had feathers on at least some parts of its body, due to their presence in related species. Below is an artistic interpretation of the T. rex.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_velociraptor_description">Velociraptor was a bipedal, feathered carnivore with a long tail and enlarged sickle-shaped claw on each hind foot. Like Tyrannosaurus, it is also one of the most familiar dinosaurs due to its prominent role in the “Jurassic Park” movie. In real life, however, Velociraptor was roughly the size of a turkey, considerably smaller than the approximately 2 m tall reptiles seen in the films. Also, real Velociraptors were feathered and warm blooded.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_spinosaurus_description">Spinosaurus was among the largest of all known carnivorous dinosaurs, possibly larger than Tyrannosaurus. It could grow up to 14.3 metres long and could weigh around 20 tonnes. It is known to have eaten fish, and most scientists believe that it hunted both terrestrial and aquatic prey. They lived both on land and in the water as modern crocodiles do.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_pachycephalosaurus_description">Pachycephalosaurus was a bipedal herbivore with an extremely thick skull roof. Also it was one of the last living non-avian dinosaurs before the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_triceratops_description">Triceratops was a herbivorous dinosaur and one of the last known non-avian dinosaurs. It is estimated, that Triceratops could grow up to 9 meters in length, 3 meters in height and could weigh about 12 tonnes.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_ankylosaurus_description">Ankylosaurus was a genus of the armored dinosaurs which was among the last of the surviving non-avian dinosaurs. Large individuals measured up to 6.25 meters in length, 1.7 meters in height and weighed 6 tonnes. Newly discovered fossils revealed, that some of the Ankylosaurus species had antipredator colorations, which evidence a high predator pressure towards the end of the Cretaceous.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_mosasaurus_description">Mosasaurus is an extinct carnivorous aquatic lizard which could grow up to 17 meters in length. It is believed, that it lived close to the ocean surface, where it preyed on fish, turtles, ammonites, smaller mosasaurs, birds, pterosaurs and plesiosaurs.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_ammonite_description">Ammonites is an extinct group of marine mollusc animals. They are excellent index fossils and appeared in the Devonian. They are mentioned here, because they are the most famous mollusc group extinct in the Cretaceous-Paleogene event.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_therizinosaurus_description">Therizinosaurus cheloniformis was a large and unique dinosaur. At 10 meters in length and 5 tons in weight, they also had gigantic claws, longest known from any animal, sometimes reaching even 70 centimeters in length.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_tsintaosaurus_description">Tsintaosaurus had a characteristic “duck bill” snout and a battery of powerful teeth which were used to chew vegetation. It was about 10 meters long and 3.6 meters tall.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_deinocherus_description">Deinocheirus was an unusual dinosaur, largest growing up to 11 meters long, and weighing 6.4 tonnes. It had a pair of large arms and probably was omnivorous. It used those long claws for digging and gathering plants. It is thought, that Deinocherus was a slow animal.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_quetzalcoatlus_description">Quetzalcoatlus was a very large pterosaur and one of the largest known flying animals of all time. Its name comes from the Mesoamerican feathered serpent god, Quetzalcoatl. Its wingspan reached 10&#8211;11 meters and whole individual was at least 3 meters tall.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_giganotosaurus_description">Giganotosaurus was a large dinosaur, similar or even larger than Tyrannosaurus. It lived in what is now Argentina. Like Tyrannosaurus, it had a metabolism intermediate between that of mammals and reptiles, and was able to sustain a stable body temperature.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_linhenykus_description">Linhenykus is the only known a non-avian dinosaur to have a single digit. It was small-bodied and lived in what is now Mongolia. Although it looks like an ostrich, it is not related to them.</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_sarcosuchus_description">Sarcosuchus is an extinct genus of crocodyliform and distant relative of living crocodylians. It is one of the largest crocodile&#8211;like reptiles and it lived in what is now Africa and South America. It was almost twice as long (up to 11&#8211;12 m) as the modern saltwater crocodile and weighed up to 8 tonnes. They lived in freshwater environment and probably hunted both fish and terrestrial prey (like the Nile crocodiles do).</string>
    <string name="cretaceous_microraptor_description">Microraptor was a genus of small, four-winged paravian dinosaurs. Their well-preserved fossils provide important evidence about the evolutionary relationship between birds and dinosaurs. It was among the most abundant non-avialan dinosaurs in its ecosystem. Adult specimens estimated up to 77 centimeters long and weighed up to 1 kilogram. Microraptor was an opportunistic predator, which hunted on small mammals, other bird-like dinosaurs and fish.</string>

    <string name="paleogene_gastornis_description">Gastornis were very large birds that lived during the Late Paleocene and Eocene. They could grow up to 2 metres in height and have traditionally been considered to be predators of small mammals. However, several lines of evidence, including the lack of hooked claws in known Gastornis footprints and studies of their beak structure have caused scientists to reinterpret these birds as herbivores that probably fed on tough plant material and seeds.</string>

    <string name="neogene_argentavis_description">Argentavis is among the largest flying birds ever to exist, having an estimated wing span of 5&#8211;6 meters, a height of 1.5&#8211;2 meters and a mass of approximately 70 kilograms. It probably preferred to scavenge for carrion.</string>
    <string name="neogene_ardipithecus_description">Ardipithecus might be one of the earliest ancestors of humans after they diverged from the main ape lineage, although it is still a matter of debate. It was very similar to chimpanzees and lived in the territory of the modern Ethiopia. Ardipithecus had a small brain, measuring between 300 and 350 cm3. This is slightly smaller than a modern chimpanzee brain and roughly 20% the size of the modern human brain. Nevertheless, it is in some ways unlike chimpanzees, suggesting that the common ancestor differs from the modern chimpanzee. After the chimpanzee and human lineages diverged, both underwent substantial evolutionary change. Chimp feet are specialized for grasping trees; Ardipithecus feet are better suited for walking.</string>
    <string name="neogene_megalodon_description">Carcharodon megalodon also known as megalodon is an extinct species of shark which lived almost until the end of the Neogene. It was one of the largest and most powerful predators in vertebrate history, reaching 18 metres in length. It is known, that they preyed on whales and fish. They extinct probably because of the multiple reasons, including the oceanic cooling, sea level drops and the decline in food supply.</string>
    <string name="neogene_levyatan_description">Livyatan is an extinct whale, similar in size to the modern sperm whale. It reached almost 18 meters in length and had powerful functional teeth in both of its jaws. It was an apex predator along with the giant megalodon. Its extinction was likely caused by a cooling event at the end of the Miocene which resulted in a drop in food populations. The formations where the whale has been found have also preserved a large assemblage of marine life, such as sharks and marine mammals.</string>
    <string name="neogene_titanis_description">Titanis walleri is a large extinct flightless carnivorous bird, which lived in the North America. It was about 2.5 meters tall and weighed approximately 150 kilograms. It is one of the famous terror birds, which were dominant predators in the early Cenozoic and Middle Cenozoic era.</string>

    <string name="quaternary_mammutus_description">Mammoths were large mammals, close elephant relatives covered by the long hair. Most of the mammoths were as large as the modern Asian elephants and lived in the northern hemisphere where colder climate was prevalent.\nThey fed on trees and shrubs. Mammoths vanished from Africa about 3&#8211;4 million years ago, from Europe and American mainland – about 10,000 years ago and some small populations survived almost until the recent days. The last known population lived in Wrangel island, until it died 3750 years ago.\nThe main cause of their extinction was the warming climate that occurred 12,000 years ago, accompanied by a glacial retreat, rising sea levels and diminishing of the plain tundra by the forests.\nCurrently, there are two separate projects in Japan and South Korea working towards recreating mammoth specimens from the DNA extracted from the frozen mammoths. Also, there is an ongoing project in the northeastern part of Russia called Pleistocene Park, where the russian scientist S. Zimov and his team are trying to prepare pasture for the possibly cloned mammoths. I really recommend watching a VICE documentary called “The Crazy Solution For Keeping The Melting Arctic Frozen”.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_coelodonta_description">Coelodonta is an extinct genus of woolly rhinoceros that lived in Eurasia almost until the recent days. Many species of Pleistocene megafauna, like woolly rhinoceros, became extinct around the same period. Human hunting is often cited as the possible cause of their extinction. Other extinction theories are associated with the climate change and the receding ice age. The last woolly rhinoceros population lived in Western Siberia about 10,000 years ago.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_megatherium_description">Megatherium was a genus of elephant-size ground sloths, that lived in South America. It weighed around 4 tonnes and measured up to 6 meters in length. It was adapted to temperate, arid or semi-arid open habitats. It fed on leaves such as yuccas, agaves and grasses. They died about 10,000 years ago because of the fragmentation of their habitats.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_smilodon_description">Smilodon is the best known as the saber tooth cat. It lived in the Americas almost until the recent days and could weigh almost 400 kilograms and grow up to 120 cm tall. They hunted large herbivores such as bisons and camels. They extinct together with the other large herbivores, because prey became smaller and more agile.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_coelacanth_description">Latimeria (or Coelacanth) is the oldest known living lobe-finned fish, known as the living fossil. They may live as long as 80 to 100 years and live as deep as 700 m below sea level. They feed on squids, small sharks and other fish. Scientists suspect one reason this fish has been so successful is that the specimens are able to slow down their metabolism at will. They live near the Sodwana Bay, South Africa.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_xiphosura_description">The Xiphosura, which includes the horseshoe crabs is the group, that hardly changed in millions of years and are considered to be the living fossils. They are related with another dominant Paleozoic arthropod group – trilobites. Their blood is very important for the modern medicine, because it is used for the detection of the bacterial endotoxins.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_ginkgo_description">Ginkgo is the only living species of the ancient plant division Ginkgophyta. It is found in fossils dating back 270 million years. Native to China, the tree is widely cultivated and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of food.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_welwitschia_description">Welwitschia is one of the three genus of the ancient plant division Gnetophyta. It grows in the Namib desert and is known as a living fossil. Many current individuals are over 1000 years old and some may be more than 2000 years old. Welwitschia produces a single pair of foliage leaves. Gnetophyta plants are relatives of the modern flowering plants.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_tuatara_description">Tuatara are reptiles endemic to New Zealand and the only alive specimens of the ancient reptile group – Rhynchocephalia, which flourished around 200 million years ago. They measure up to 80 cm and weigh up to 1.3 kg. They are terrestrial and nocturnal and thrive in much lower temperatures than those tolerated by most reptiles and hibernate during winter.\nNow they are extremely endangered because of the introduced rats and the habitat loss.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_human_description">Human or Homo sapiens is the most successful large vertebrate species to ever roam the Earth.  The estimated human population by the 2017 is around 7.5 billion and humans occupy most of the natural niches except the deep oceans, salt lakes, deep caves and Antarctica (although there are some specimens reported to live there, at least seasonally). It is currently deemed of “least concern” on the Red List of endangered species by the IUCN.\nTraditionally, there are two competing views of paleoanthropology about the origin of the H. sapiens: the recent African origin and the multiregional origin. More accepted single origin theory states, that modern humans appeared in East Africa and later migrated up north, when the glaciers retreated. They overwhelmed northern living H. neanderthalensis, which were already losing their genetic diversity and later migrated all around the world, by killing and destroying most of the natural habitats and animal species on their way. Later it became an apex, opportunistic predator, however different human populations specialized in different kind of food, for example: Japanese are regarded as the most ferocious marine predators, killing thousands of whales, dolphins, sharks and other sea animals each year; Chinese are known for their passion of killing rhinoceros, elephants and other horned animals, they even recently wiped out the Northern White Rhinoceros species in Africa, great job! European populations have depleted their natural resources long time ago, so they usually use other populations to bring them food and are best known for their manipulative skills and so on.\nThe human creating this application is about 1.83 meters long and weights about 69 kilograms, and is alive because of the photosynthesis.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_dodo_description">The dodo is an extinct flightless bird that was endemic to the island of Mauritius, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. It was about 1 metre tall and may have weighed up to 17 kg and is related to the pigeons. The dodo was historically been considered fat and clumsy, but it was well-adapted for its ecosystem. It used gizzard stones to help digest their food (mainly fruits).\nThe first recorded mention of the dodo was by Dutch sailors in 1598. In the following years, the bird was hunted by sailors and invasive species, while its habitat was being destroyed. The last widely accepted sighting of a dodo was in 1662. The extinction of the dodo within less than a century of its discovery called attention to the previously unrecognized problem of human involvement in the disappearance of entire species.</string>
    <string name="quaternary_megalania_description">Megalania is an extinct giant lizard and it was a part of a megafauna that inhabited southern Australia during the Pleistocene. The youngest fossil remains date around 50,000 years ago. The first aboriginal settlers of Australia might have encountered them and been a factor in their extinction. Largest individuals could grow up to 7 m long with a maximum weight of approximately 600&#8211;620 kg. It fed mostly upon medium to large sized animals and had a jaw full of serrated blade-like teeth.</string>
